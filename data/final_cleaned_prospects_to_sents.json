League.", "His lack of strength has limited him a bit against the more mature, organized defenses he's faced.", "His quickness is an obvious asset, especially when he asserts himself defending on the

establish his dominance as a post scorer and offensive rebounder early and often.", "Meeks can carve out deep paint position on lankier big men, and scouts will want to see how Bell is able to handle him, as its a similar test to what he might see on certain nights in the NBA as an undersized center.", "Bell has been inconsistent at times as a defensive rebounder, but will need to be dominant in this department against the 1 offensive rebounding team in the country for Oregon to have any chance of winning.", "Jordan Bell was the hero for Oregon against Michigan on both ends of the floor, being an incredible difference maker with his athleticism and energy.", "His ability to switch onto the perimeter and stay in front of guards was essential in the Sweet 16, and he now faces perhaps the biggest test of his college career in Kansas' vaunted backcourt, which has been on fire as of late .", "Kansas will pose a much bigger test, and scouts will be watching to see how he fares against the rock solid Landen Lucas, who did a great job against Purdue's outstanding frontcourt on Thursday.", "Kyle Nelson After a promising freshman season, Oregon big man Jordan Bell spent his entire summer and eight games into his sophomore campaign recovering from foot surgery.", "While his sophomore season was inconsistent, Bell recovered by March and played a key role on Oregon's NCAA

term as much as needed.", "He runs the floor well in transition, demonstrates excellent quickness and mobility covering ground exceptionally well all over the court, and is highly explosive around the

all of his possessions in the immediate vicinity of the basket, but was given more opportunities to create looks for himself in the post as a sophomore.", "Bell saw a majority of his touches off of cuts to the basket, in transition, and off of his teammates misses.", "On film, it's clear as to why this is the case.", "While he occasionally strings together a series of impressive plays, his post repertoire is limited to spin moves and the occasional up and under.", "In general, he still relies on his quickness over fundamentals to score in the post.", "Bell continued to show some potential in his face up game, but in a relatively small sample size.", "Likewise, he displays better shooting mechanics than you would expect from a 51.9 free throw shooter, but on just 12 attempts and to inconclusive results.", "He is at his best, however, while using his physical tools to his advantage and letting his teammates create opportunities for him.", "Most notably, he is a reliable finisher in transition and does a good job of cutting to the basket.", "Bell's defensive versatility and overall prowess is what will give him a chance to make a NBA roster and stick long term.", "Few players show the ability to cover ground the way he can, as he displays an excellent combination of lateral quickness, agility and quick twitch explosiveness, which allows him to defend big men, forwards, wings and guards all over the floor, while disrupting passing lanes, and altering shots at the basket.", "He once again stood out as one of a handful of players in our database to average two blocks

seasons to help him hold his own inside, but he has plenty of time to work on his body in the coming years.", "Capable of playing above the rim and showing nice explosiveness inside, Bell has average footwork and touch and tries to do too much in the air at times.", "Getting to the line at a low rate, shooting only 50 once he gets there, and showing little post game to speak of, Bell has a long way to go offensively as his skill level is clearly still catching up with his physical tools, even if he surprises you at times with his court vision and passing ability.", "As a rebounder, Bell is capable on both ends, but could be more aggressive crashing the boards.", "Where Bell does already make contributions is as a shot blocker, an area where he ranked among the top 20 players in the entire country on a per minute basis.", "Committing 4.4 fouls per 40 minutes pace adjusted while blocking 4.1 shots, Bell can be a bit too aggressive at times defensively, but flashes terrific potential as a rim protector.", "As an on ball defender, Bell is a bit less successful, as more mature, polished, and stronger post scorers take advantage of his lack of strength and discipline

past, Jordan Bell got the opportunity to play significant minutes right away.", "Players in his mold can make big, sudden jumps in ability so it makes sense to continue to keep track of his progress

NCAA just a day before his freshman season started, Tacko Fall was able to seamlessly incorporate himself back into the UCF rotation after missing nearly a week of pre season practice to be a productive rotation player.", "Now the tallest player in the NCAA by several inches after UC Irvine's Mamadou Ndiaye declared for the NBA Draft, the 7'6\u0094 Fall will be looking to build on a strong freshman season,after averaging 16.7 points, 13.3 rebounds and 5.3 blocks per 40 minutes in seventeen minutes of action per game.", "Born in Senegal, and only playing basketball for a few years, having crisscrossed the country before landing at UCF, Fall is clearly still at an early stage of his development.", "Fall has a reported wingspan that spans over eight feet, which gives him an elite reach around the rim.", "The rest of his physical tools raise questions about his ability to break into a rotation in the modern NBA, as he lacks a high level of lateral quickness to move in space or a strong frame to carve out space around the rim.", "With the NBA focusing on smaller and quicker lineups, Fall will need to show how he could make his mark at the next level using his size and length, something he has time to do with three years of eligibility remaining.45.9 of Fall's total possessions were logged as post ups by Synergy Sports Technology, but he struggled to score as a freshman at times, even with a clear size advantage.", "Once he gets the ball, if he has deep position, he can turn and shoot a hook shot over his defender, but he struggles if he needs to start his move away from the rim.", "His footwork is rudimentary, and when he tries to make a move either with his back to the basket or from a face up position, he often gets off balance and is ineffective.", "Fall's lack of high level experience was evident as a freshman, as he was somewhat of a black hole at times once receiving the ball, averaging just 0.8 assists compared to 3.7 turnovers per 40 minutes.", "When he did pass out of the post, his passes were inaccurate and his teammates struggled to turn them into points.", "He also has a tendency to clog the lane when looking to post up and will demand the ball even when surrounded by defenders, which can bog down the offense.", "His size helps him score with the back to the basket, but he is by no means a dominant post player at this point and he will need to improve his footwork, passing ability and overall understanding of the game to be a more well rounded post scorer.", "With that said, Fall is nearly automatic when he catches the ball heading toward the rim, and he converted 74.7 of his shots at the rim according to Synergy Sports Technology.", "His 75 two point field goal percentage ranked third among all players who played at least thirty games last season and he was easily able to finish on baseline cuts or offensive rebounds, as he has solid hands to make easy catches and finishes, and a solid feel for rotating into space to present himself for layups and dunks.", "Fall averaged 4.1 offensive rebounds per 40 minutes last season, a solid mark, especially for a raw freshman.", "He will step out to the perimeter and set a ball screen, but he's slow to roll to the rim, taking a wide line to the rim instead of rolling straight down the paint, which limits his effectiveness out of this play type.", "He would be a prime target for a lob pass with his reach, but he can be slow getting off the ground, and will get knocked off his path by contact.", "While there is no question about Fall's ability to score when he is right at the rim, scouts will be watching to see whether he can expand his offensive game as a sophomore and beyond, which will help him stay effective as the competition level stiffens.", "Fall rarely left the paint defensively, and was able to focus solely on protecting the rim and rebounding.", "His 5.3 blocks per 40 minutes ranked third in the NCAA last season and while he was able to be a productive shot blocker, he took himself out of plays by biting on ball fakes or trying to block shots that he had no chance to block.", "Fall's 9.2 defensive rebounds is an impressive mark, and improving his strength and explosiveness could help him progress in this area even more.", "He uses his arms rather than his body to hold off opponents at times, and is only going to get rebounds that fall right to his area when he is in rebounding position.", "If his feel as a shot blocker can improve and he limits the amount of shots he tries to block, he could become a more productive rebounder by being in position to be first to the ball off the rim with his reach.", "He'll need to get stronger to defend the post consistently and significantly quicker stepping out to the perimeter.", "He was foul prone even in his limited defensive role, averaging almost six fouls per 40 minutes.", "Fall has already shown his value as a shot blocker and rebounder early on, but he'll need to prove he can also contribute as an all around defender to take the next step in his development, especially when asked to move laterally in the half court.", "Fall demonstrated flashes of impressive prowess around the rim on each end as a freshman, and will be monitored closely to see how he progresses moving forward.", "While his enormous size will keep him on the radar of NBA teams, the soon the be 21 year old Fall will need to prove how he can fit into the modern NBA game in the upcoming years to raise his profile as a draft prospect.", "It's somewhat understandable why Fall is such a raw prospect considering the circuitous route he took to the NCAA, so it will be interesting to monitor his improvement and whether he's able to continue to post gaudy rebounding and block numbers as his minutes increase."], "P.J.

J. Dozier is an interesting prospect with excellent physical tools who got the opportunity, for better or worse, to learn on the job last season.", "Frank Martin will look to Dozier to take the next step to help compensate for the departures of his team's entire starting frontcourt and three most efficient offensive players.", "It's a little early to speculate about what direction Dozier's game is heading.", "Whether his future is as a playmaker, or if he can take a page from the De Andre Liggins playbook and rebrand himself as a lockdown defender who can spread the floor a bit, remains to be seen.", "With three years of eligibility remaining, Dozier has plenty of time to sort out those details and emerge as a viable NBA prospect.", "Video, Highlights, and Interview courtesy of 312 Media."], "T.J.

2010 to 2014.", "A late bloomer out of Westfield High School in Houston, standing just 5'10 as a sophomore, Iwundu was a rather unheralded recruit who received only a few high level Division I offers, but has since turned himself into a dynamic player with intriguing professional upside.", "From a physical perspective Iwundu definitely passes the eye test.", "At 6'7\u0094 with a plus wingspan a number which you would like to see much higher given his size and physical profile.", "Despite Iwundu's unique playmaking skills for a player his size, he has yet to show that he possesses consistent perimeter shooting skills, which significantly limits him in the half court at times.", "As a freshman he made a career high seven 3 pointers on just 17 attempts from deep, but has fallen off drastically the last two seasons, and hit only 12 of his 49 attempts from beyond the arc as a sophomore and junior.", "He shot only 3 for 21 on jumpers off the dribble last season, and showcases

summer in the media saying he has completely reconstructed his jumper, and has put in significant work on this part of his game, so it will be interesting to see if he gets better results as a senior.", "An improved jump shot would go a long way for Iwundu, if he forces defenses to respect his shooting ability, only opening up more playmaking lanes for the versatile swingman.", "Voted to the 2016 Big 12 All Defensive Team, a significant part of Iwundu's potential rests on his versatility on this end of the floor.", "With his size, length, and mobility, Iwundu has the tools to defend guards and wings, and can occasionally switch on to some small ball power forwards, even if struggles with bigger and stronger players.", "He's an effective and aggressive on ball defender who averaged 1.7 steals per 40 last season, but also picks up some unnecessary fouls away from the basket which you would like to see him eliminate if he moved his feet more and relied less on his length.", "He shows some lapses off the ball at times, getting caught out of a stance, putting himself in difficult close out situations that he can only sometimes make up for with his length.",

his name solidified in the NBA draft conversation.", "He has shown a great deal of potential as a playmaking wing with defensive versatility, but in order to boost his professional stock, he'll need to show an improved jump shot and continue to play with more efficiency on the offensive end of the floor.", "As the senior leader, he'll have ample opportunity to show NBA personnel that he has the

to get off his feet quickly to attack the rim ferociously with a strong vertical leap.", "Iwundu is a fairly limited offensive player at this point in time, seeing most of his possessions playing off the ball for Kansas State as somewhat of a hybrid combo forward charged with running the floor in transition, moving off the ball, crashing the offensive glass, and shooting the occasional jump shot.", "His quick first step allows him to attack the basket in a straight line when given an open lane, where he can finish with authority or draw fouls at a solid rate, but his rudimentary ball handling skills limit him significantly as a shot creator in the half court.", "His pull up jump shot is rather crude as well, as he made just 4 of his 18 attempts of this nature as a freshman and 63 of his free throw attempts.", "Iwundu's jump shot shows potential with his feet set, as he knocked down a handful of catch and shoot jumpers last season in Big 12 play, displaying decent mechanics and nice shooting touch.", "He's still working on becoming more consistent in this area, though, as his release is somewhat on the slow side and he's prone to shooting on the way down at times when rushed.", "He obviously has a ways to go in this area, but shows just enough potential here to lead you to believe he can develop this part of his game in time, something that will play a significant

his four seasons, culminating in averages of 25.6 points and 11.3 rebounds per 40 minutes on a 60.4 true shooting percentage as a senior.", "His senior season ended unceremoniously, with Peters missing the final four games of the season with a stress fracture in his right leg, resulting in his team losing in the first round of their conference tournament.", "The injury robbed casual fans and NBA scouts of seeing him in the NCAA Tournament, and will likely prevent him from partaking in the pre draft process.", "Still, NBA teams have plenty of film to properly evaluate Peters, with

freshman season, Alec Peters responded by taking another big jump as a sophomore.", "Peters finished his second season at Valparaiso with averages of 16.8 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 1.2 assists per game, which earned him All Conference First Team honors.", "When Peters arrived at Valparaiso, his primary contribution was as a jump shooter, where Peters made 38.3 of his 149 three point attempts during his freshman season.", "That shot continues to be Peters' calling card, as he built upon that strength to become an even more dangerous shooter, knocking down 46.6 of his 178 three point attempts.", "To put in perspective just how prolific of a rate that was, only three players in all of college basketball who attempted at least 150 three point attempts last season did so more efficiently than Peters did.", "Getting Peters open corner threes was an offense in itself for Valparaiso last season, as they did an excellent job of using screens and movement to get Peters shots from this extremely efficient part of the court, and Peters was virtually automatic from the corners.", "Peters moves extremely well off the ball, has impeccable footwork to step into the shot, and has a short, compact, and extremely repeatable shooting motion that allows him to get his shot off quickly and accurately with very little space.", "According to Synergy Sports Technology, Peters shot 42.7 on jump shots overall, which included 44 in catch and shoot situations, 39.4 when shooting off screens, and 35.7 when shooting off the dribble.", "The points per possession those situations yielded was a very low number for a player who used the amount of possessions Peters did.", "With his offensive game expanding and seeing the occasional double team in the post, Peters seemed to make good reads out of these situations.", "The NBA is always looking for 6 9 forwards who can stretch the floor, and Peters should be able to do that at any level.", "Where the biggest concern is going to come is on the defensive end, where his physical limitations present themselves with concerning frequency.", "These problems are compounded by an upright stance, a habit of biting on pump fakes, and a frequency to find himself off balance on misdirection moves.", "The fact that he's accumulated just 47 steals and 14 blocks in nearly 2000 minutes of action at the college level is a red flag that NBA teams will likely scrutinize.", "Valparaiso was a good defensive rebounding team, with a number of wings who could pinch down and contribute on the defensive glass, which could have impacted Peters' defensive rebounding opportunities.", "Peters does do a pretty good job of putting a body on his man and keeping him off the glass, so this is a concern that could fade over time, but it would be nice to see Peters rebound outside of his area with a little bit more regularity.", "Peters has one certifiable NBA skill in his jump shot, and it's one that absolutely has significant value in today's NBA.", "The diversification Peters showed in his offensive game bodes well for his ability to continue to improve as a player, but improving his strength, quickness, and ball handling, while continuing to make a stronger impact on defense, would go a long way to increasing the chance that Peters hears his name called on draft night when he does put his name in the mix.", "Valparaiso has a much tougher out of conference schedule this season, so Peters will have the chance to prove his worth against a higher level of competition."], "Luke Kornet": [" After a somewhat slow start to the season, partially due to injury, Luke Kornet came on very strong for Vanderbilt in SEC play, winning First Team All Conference honors as well as a spot on the All Defensive team.", "Kornet has yet to

solid feel for the game, theoretical floor spacing potential and decent instincts defensively give hope he can turn into the type of stretch 5 many NBA teams covet.", "Derek Bodner After being overlooked for much of his high school career, Luke Kornet's late growth spurt, and some big performances on the AAU circuit, eventually put him on the map as a recruit.", "Kornet eventually settled on Vanderbilt, following in the path of his father, Frank Kornet, who helped lead the Commodores to back to back NCAA tournament appearances in the late 1980's.", "In many respects, Kornet, listed at 7'1\", 250 pounds by Vanderbilt, showed progress as a junior for the Commodores.", "His rebounding, a big weakness in his game up to that point, improved from 6.0 rebounds per 40 minutes, pace adjusted, to 10.9.", "He blocked significantly more shots .", "Still, the season on the whole was slightly disappointing for the 7'1\" Kornet, in large part because of his struggles shooting from the perimeter.", "After connecting on an even 40 of his 125 three point attempts as a sophomore Kornet connected on just 28 as a junior, while taking a step back from the free throw line as well.", "Kornet improved somewhat in the second half of the year, shooting 31.4 from three point range in his last 14 games, compared to just 23.8 in the first 14, but he never truly regained the shooting touch that made him such an intriguing prospect.", "Some of Kornet's struggles from the perimeter can come down to shot selection, as he's more than willing to take contested shots, shots off the dribble, and shots from well beyond the collegiate three point line.", "Despite his struggles last year Kornet has great mechanics on his jump shot and a repeatable, quick shooting motion that should suggest his struggles last year can be overcome, but becoming a little bit more selective in his shot selection would certainly help him in that regard.", "Kornet is mostly an opportunistic scorer outside of jumpers.", "He has solid touch around the basket and moves well without the ball, but he's mostly a below the rim player, despite his size.", "He can score on the occasional post up when he has a size advantage with basic hook shots, but while he's made some minor progress in developing his upper body strength and looks like he has a frame that can continue to fill out, his lower body strength is still a weak point and he struggles to establish decent post position, usually resorting to a low percentage turnaround jump shot rather than forcing his way inside with a move toward the basket.", "Kornet does have some perimeter skills which gives him more than just pick and pop potential, though.", "Nobody is going to mistake Kornet for a high level shot creator at the next level, but the skills are there to be able to take advantage of the closeouts he'll receive if he's able to force defenders to respect his jump shot.", "Defensively, it's a little bit harder to project Kornet at the next level.", "He can overcome this at times with an occasional block thanks to his length, but his tendency to get pushed around is something that he's going to have to improve upon as he physically matures.", "The combination of his struggles in the post and his inability to defend the perimeter is going to be tough to overcome, as he would be a liability regardless of whether he's defending the power forward or center position at this stage of his career.", "On the plus side, Kornet did make drastic improvements in his output in the defensive glass, grabbing 19.7 of the available defensive rebounds when he was on the court.", "While this was a significant improvement over the 13.2 he grabbed as a sophomore, it's still an average at best figure for a seven footer who was playing near the basket frequently, and his lack of lower body strength once again was a big factor in this facet of the game.", "He gave more consistent effort this past season, but he's still going to struggle to physically compete.", "In some respects, Luke Kornet made a lot of improvements to round out his game this past season.", "Still, when you project out Kornet's role to the NBA, he's going to succeed or fail based on his ability as a jump shooter.", "If he can continue to develop as an all around player, and regain the shooting touch he showed as a sophomore, he'll stay on the draft radar for a league desperate for big men who can stretch the floor.", "Kyle Nelson Between his junior and senior seasons in high school, Luke Kornet grew from 6'3 to 6'10.", "Now listed at 7'1, Kornet has developed into a unique commodity, a big man with unlimited range who can also score efficiently around the basket.", "While Kornet emerged as an intriguing, albeit inconsistent player, scouts will be watching to see if he can take the next step forward as a junior alongside of Damion Jones.", "At 7'1 and 240 pounds with long arms, Kornet has excellent size for either post position.", "The junior big man needs to tone his frame considerably, however, as his 240 pound frame still has a ways to go to reach its full potential, even if he has big shoulders and plenty of room to keep filling out.", "Coming off of foot surgery over the summer, just how well Kornet can maximize his physical tools carries significant implications for his professional prospects.", "Playing mostly a backup role for Vanderbilt, Kornet averaged 16.3 points per 40 minutes pace adjusted and attempted more shots from beyond the arc than he did inside it, which makes perfect sense considering the success he enjoyed on the perimeter.", "Kornet's most intriguing attribute from an NBA perspective is his perimeter shooting ability.", "While his release can still get quicker, he has picture perfect form and range out to the NBA 3 point line.", "Kornet made 40.7 of his 6.8 three point field goal attempts per 40 minutes pace adjusted, standing out as one of the top perimeter shooting big men in our database.", "Kornet looked particularly impressive as a spot up option, ranking in the 99th percentile among college basketball players in those situations according to Synergy Sports Technology.", "Kornet's unlimited range and impressive ability to stretch the floor is a valuable skill worth monitoring moving forward, especially with the NBA's increasing emphasis on having shooters at every position on the floor.", "Inside of the three point line, Kornet proved to be a mixed bag.", "On the one hand, he made an impressive 62 of his 2 point attempts, including 48.1 of his post up looks and 74 of his non post up shot attempts inside the paint.", "In the post, Kornet demonstrates a soft touch, developing footwork, and a willingness to pass out of trouble.", "On the other hand, stronger defenders easily push him off the block due to his lack of strength and he struggles to finish through contact in traffic.", "He showed some potential as a passer and attacking closeouts in small doses, which are things he can continue to fine tune to add versatility to his game.", "While Kornet has a clear cut role offensively at the pro level, his ability to hold his own on the other end of the floor remains a question mark.", "His 6.1 rebounds per 40 minutes pace adjusted rank him among the worst rebounding big men in our database, and would put him among the lowest figures ever for a big man draft pick if they continued to hold true.", "His lack of strength and quickness also limits him as a post defender, where stronger offensive players have little trouble backing him down or spinning by him to the basket.", "Furthermore, his subpar foot speed does him few favors guarding the pick and roll or staying in front of offensive players who face him up.", "His size and length do allow him to block 1.9 shots per 40 minutes pace adjusted, but at this point it is hard he has significant work ahead of him before he can be counted on to defend either post position at the next level.", "Thus, while Kornet is an extremely unique player with his combination of size and shooting touch, he has a long way to maximize his potential as a NBA prospect.", "In the meantime, he must continue to get stronger and improve his rebounding and defense.", "With a more consistent junior season, Luke Kornet should continue to get attention from scouts and has the potential to develop into a legitimate NBA prospect before he is done in Nashville."], "Vince Edwards": ["Josh Riddell Vince Edwards has quickly established himself as a key member of the Purdue Boilermakers by starting nearly every game in his two year career, while being a significant contributor to back to back NCAA Tournament teams.", "Edwards is a well rounded offensive contributor as he

with a 7'0\u0094 wingspan, Edwards has ideal size for the small forward position and with his chiseled 225 pound frame, has the strength to play the power forward spot.", "Athletically, he is just average, lacking a degree of quickness and explosiveness.", "While A. J. Hammons has graduated, Purdue still features two prominent big men in Isaac Haas and Caleb Swanigan and are expected to continue to feature them together in lineups.", "This has allowed Edwards to display his versatility by playing both the small forward and power forward spot in various lineups, which has demonstrated to NBA teams that he can be used in different ways at the next level.", "Edwards made a substantial leap in his three point shooting accuracy in his sophomore year, as he saw his percentages rise from 32.6 to 40.7 on 4.7 attempts per 40 minutes.", "There is still a substantial dip in his somewhat mechanical looking jump shot, which can slow his release and renders him more ineffective when closely guarded, but it's encouraging to see an uptick in his overall efficiency.", "If he can replicate his accuracy from the three point line as a junior, and speed up his release somewhat, it will go a long way in proving he can be a credible shooting threat from the perimeter at the NBA level.", "He has displayed some potential as a slasher from the wing, but this area of his skill set is still a work in progress.", "He reads the defense well on drives and recognizes the open areas to find the best possible shot for his teammates or for himself, whether that means passing out early, a pull up jump shot or navigating all the way to the rim.", "One area that he will need to improve upon as he develops his attacking game is his ability to finish around the rim in traffic.", "He was able to get to the line 3.7 times per 40 by using his strong frame to absorb contact which helped his efficiency on dribble penetration, but he will need to find more ways to score off the bounce since he may struggle to finish against NBA length.", "Edwards flashed some skill as a passer by averaging 4.2 assists to 2.4 turnovers per 40.", "He can make the right reads from a standstill by seeing cutters, entering the ball into the post or swinging the ball in the flow of the offense to keep the action moving.", "He started to show some skill as a passer on the move and adding that ability to his arsenal will be the next step in his player development.", "This will help cement his ability to play from the wing as a multi faceted offensive attacker.", "While Edwards took a step forward in demonstrating what roles he can fill on the offensive end, he is still struggling to show off his defensive value, which is a major component of his potential role at the NBA level.", "He can switch everything on the perimeter, but he uses this as a crutch to sag way off his man and fails to fight through screens, which allows the offense to move freely.", "He did improve as a defensive rebounder and showed more of a desire to help his team finish plays as a sophomore by averaging 5.2 defensive rebounds per 40.", "However, he failed to produce steals which demonstrates and awareness his lack of aggression on that end.", "Edwards will continue to have ample opportunity to round out his skill set from the small forward position in a two big lineup while also being able to play some minutes as a power forward to show off his versatility.", "He will be 20

another leap as a junior to make a bigger impression with NBA scouts.", "The son of longtime European basketball professional Bill Edwards options.", "The Boilermakers will need floor spacing around their old school pivots, and Edwards will need to be able to provide that if they are to be successful while he's on the floor.", "He had a very successful freshman season, but will now need to take

stands just over 6'8\" in shoes, with a 6'11\" wingspan and an upper body that looks as if it can fill out over time as he matures physically.", "He combines that with an advanced, diversified skill level and flashes of two way potential, which makes it easy to see why Tatum has been a top rated prospect all season long.", "Tatum's bread and butter remains his strong isolation game, where nearly a quarter of his possessions came from, according to Synergy Sports Technology.", "Tatum was either too big, too quick, or too skilled for virtually any defender opponents could throw his way, and Duke exploited that whenever they could, particularly as the season moved along.", "Tatum is a very smooth athlete at 6'8\", with a wide array of moves and footwork well beyond what you would typically expect from a prospect who just turned 19 earlier this month.", "Tatum has a full assortment of effective jab steps, crossovers, turnarounds, fadeaways, and in and out dribbles to get his defender off balance and create separation.", "He used this combination of size, quickness, and ability to create separation with devastating effect, especially when guarded by slower power forwards.", "Tatum has added to his arsenal over the last year by diversifying his offensive attack.", "That improvement starts on the perimeter, as Tatum connected on 34.2 of his four three point attempts per game, an encouraging, albeit still inconsistent, addition to his game for a player who struggled from deep at times as a high school prospect.", "Tatum is most effective on the perimeter when he has time to gather himself, as he shot 40.5 on unguarded catch and shoot shots, according to Synergy Sports Technology, most of which were from three point range.", "That form broke down a little bit when rushed, as defensive pressure resulted in some inconsistencies in his balance and shooting motion, and the 29.3 Tatum shot on contested catch and shoot shots ranked in the bottom third of qualified players.", "Shortening his release and speeding it up will likely be a focus for Tatum early on in his career, especially if a team eases him into a role rather than asking him to be a primary initiator from day one.", "Tatum also showed the ability to make shots pulling up off the dribble, especially going to his left, where he was particularly comfortable using one or two rhythm dribbles to generate space.", "This is both a blessing and a curse, as while it allowed Tatum to shoulder a heavier offensive burden for the Blue Devils, he was also a little bit too willing at times to settle for tough, contested, midrange jumpers.", "Tatum does show the ability to post up when he has a size advantage, a useful skill for a player who figures to bounce between both forward spots depending on his team's scheme and the personnel around him.", "In fact, the 1.303 points per possession Tatum generated ranked in the 99th percentile in terms of efficiency, per Synergy Sports.", "Much of the coordination and footwork that allows Tatum to create separation on the perimeter also shows up on the block, where the 19 year old has an impressive combination of moves over either shoulder.", "Drop steps, fadeaways, and hook shots are all in his arsenal even at this early stage of his career.", "With that said, there is some concern projecting certain aspects of Tatum's offensive game to the next level, most notably his ability to get to the rim against similar athletes.", "Like many tall forwards at the collegiate level, Tatum played a large portion of his minutes at the power forward spot to make way for Duke's deep perimeter attack.", "Tatum's skill level, footwork, and ability to change speeds helped him mitigate that, for the most part, at the college level, although even there he settled for more difficult pull ups and floaters than you would have preferred, shots with a high degree of difficulty and a comparatively low expected value.", "Tatum will have to further refine his ball handling and diversify his skill set in order to consistently create efficient shots for himself at a high level in the NBA.", "It would also be beneficial for Tatum if some of his ancillary skills were a little bit more consistent.", "He's gotten better shooting off the catch but, even with a high release point, still shows inconsistencies in his mechanics, and can be bothered by a strong closeout.", "His handle has improved to the point where he can consistently attack a closeout and utilize some of his advanced footwork, but is still unrefined enough where it slows him down considerably and can be prone to smaller guys digging from the perimeter and forcing turnovers.", "Tatum has the size and length to defend either forward spot, and uses his length well to contest shots, close off passing lanes, and harass players on the perimeter.", "He showed marked improvement in these areas as the year moved on, yet his technique can frequently break down, whether that be struggling to close out under control or an inconsistent perimeter stance, making him susceptible to misdirection moves.", "That last aspect, the development of his core and lower body strength to allow him to play more time in the NBA at the power forward spot, is of considerable interest.", "Tatum collected 7.2 defensive rebounds per 40 minutes, pace adjusted, while blocking 1.4 shots per 40 minutes when adjusting for pace as well.", "Jayson Tatum remains one of the more unique players in this draft, with an advanced array of offensive moves, high skill level, and a physical profile that affords him considerable potential, and versatility, on the defensive end as well.", "While this keeps Tatum's floor relatively high, there's still some question about exactly what his role will be at the next level.", "Can he continue to hone his offensive game to the point where he can develop into a high level, efficient, shot creator for both himself and his teammates?", "If not, can he continue to refine his off ball skills to be a more consistent shooter on the perimeter, and thus a more effective secondary offensive option?", "These are the questions

times, leading to inefficient play.", "He has both the tools, and the instincts to be a real playmaker in the passing lanes and as a shot blocker, but will need to show better desire to utilize them

Wilcox, relishing the opportunity Lorenzo Romar affords to him to finish as the Huskies' leader in assists and second most prolific scorer.", "Averaging 13.4 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 4.4 assists per game, Williams Goss led all Pac 12 freshmen in scoring, en route to being named to the All Conference freshman team, and in the process planted himself firmly on the radar of NBA scouts.", "Williams Goss' appeal from a NBA perspective starts with his terrific size for a primary ball handler.", "Measuring 6'4 in shoes with a 6'6' wingspan one summer ago while preparing for the U19 World Championships with USA Basketball in Colorado Springs, the Oregon native towers over some of the players he encounters at the collegiate level \u0096a significant factor in his productive freshman season given his lack of outstanding explosiveness.", "A skilled, crafty offensive player, Williams Goss has been an adept mid range scorer since he emerged as a prospect during his highly successful high school career at Findlay Prep thanks to his ability to use his size to find angles to score inside the arc.", "As a freshman, that ability to score around the paint with floaters quickly became the soon to be 20 year old's calling card, as the 68 points he scored on runners in the half court ranked among the top 15 nationally according to Synergy Sports Technology, and his 47 conversion rate on such shots is quite impressive.", "In contrast, Williams Goss still has plenty of work to do as a scorer from the outside and as a finisher.", "Though the rising sophomore showed growth as a perimeter shooter late in his high school career and connected on a very respectable 40 of his jump shots overall, maintaining that momentum as a freshman, he appears a bit out of rhythm at times and his 36 shooting from deep on 2.8 attempts per game and 72 from the line seemingly have room to improve.", "Shooting a middling 51 as a finisher at the rim, the more efficient and prolific Williams Goss can be as a shooter, the more it will overshadow his lack of great blow by quickness and ability to finish explosively inside.", "Averaging 15.5 points per 40 minutes, which ranks right in the middle of the pack among rising sophomores in our current top 100, Williams Goss should get plenty of opportunities to be more productive this season with C. J. Wilcox graduating to the professional ranks.", "It will be interesting to see how his high basketball IQ and ability to change speeds and make things happen in the pick and roll translate to a higher usage role.", "Racking up 5.1 assists and rebounds per 40 minutes pace adjusted, Williams Goss did a bit of everything for Washington a year ago.", "He has good court vision, a solid understanding of spacing, and actually appeared more comfortable attacking a set defense in the half court than pushing the ball in transition, a true rarity for freshman guard.", "One of the more mature freshman in the college game, Williams Goss' savvy carried over on the defensive end at times, where his ability to anticipate the action helped him come up with 1.1 steals per game, as he proved adept at stripping opposing big men when digging down from the perimeter.", "Unfortunately, his lack of lateral quickness led to some difficulties guarding smaller, quicker guards in one on one and pick and roll settings, despite his willingness to compete consistently at this end of the floor.", "Looking ahead, Williams Goss is in an interesting situation heading into his sophomore season.", "Whether Washington has the personnel to maintain their scoring balance as they did in those two cases this coming year remains to be seen, and if no one steps up, it will be worth monitoring how heavy of an offensive burden Williams Goss will have to carry.", "Though his lack of great athleticism will remain a concern as scouts project him to the next level, a strong sophomore year carrying the Huskies back to the NCAA Tournament could make the decision to enter the NBA Draft that he labored over last spring a bit easier come next April.", "Far more mature than you'd expect considering he's only 18 years old, Nigel Williams Goss established himself right from the start as one of the leaders of this Team USA squad, showing terrific poise and unselfishness as a facilitator in the half court.", "Interview Good in the pick and roll, and very aggressive pushing the ball up the floor, Williams Goss is a willing passer and is constantly talking on both ends of the floor, which made him a natural to continue on to the next stage of tryouts after the first round of roster cuts were made.", "He shows very good potential as a point guard, even if his average athleticism and somewhat inconsistent outside shot may limit his long term upside to a certain extent.", "His very strong mentality leaves plenty of optimism regarding how he'll address this in the future, though, and there's very little doubt that he was an absolutely huge get for Lorenzo Romar at Washington and someone we'll be following closely to see how his college career evolves.", "Matt Kamalsky Taking home the top spot in the 2013 Mc Donald's All American game 3 point contest and running the point for the West in practice, Nigel Williams Goss proved to be one of the more steady and mature guards in attendance over the course of the week.", "Standing 6'3 with a 6'7 wingspan, Williams Goss has great size for the point guard position, but lacks elite speed and explosiveness.", "Possessing a fairly mature skill set \u0096the byproduct of playing a key role for national powerhouse Findlay Prep in recent years\u0096 Williams Goss compensates for his lack of blow by speed with the ability to play at different speeds to keep his defender off balance, solid ball handling ability, and budding playmaking ability on the pick and roll.", "He shows the ability to control tempo and was one of the more willing passers over the course of the week in Chicago, showing the type of leadership, versatility, and intensity on both ends that should help him pay dividends for Lorenzo Romar's Washington Huskies as a freshman.", "With Abdul Gaddy graduating, Williams Goss should see ample opportunity to showcase his scoring and passing ability next season.", "The one time UNLV commit has no shortage of big game experience at the high school level, and though he lacks great athleticism, his skill and competitive streak makes him a player to keep an eye on down the road.", "One of the youngest players at this event and one of the more unique stories you'll find in high school basketball, Nigel Williams Goss is a high school sophomore who starts for arguably the most talented team in America.", "Sharing Findlay's backcourt with top point guard prospect Myck Kabongo, Williams Goss acts as the full time playmaker when Kabongo goes to the bench.", "Williams Goss shows nice versatility, as he's capable of making shots, scoring inside, and even posting up his opponent when the situation calls for it.", "He's a committed defender who crashes the glass extremely well and puts great effort in both on and off the ball.", "The experience he's gaining playing at this level is invaluable, as he's matching up with some of the best high school players in America both in practice and in games before he even turns 16 years old.", "As other players begin to catch up to him physically, it will be important for him to continue to round out his game, which is why playing at this level is probably a very smart move long term, rather than just dominating his age group with his sheer strength and smarts.", "Its difficult to project the say with any certainty what type of upside Williams Goss possesses at this stage, but it's a pretty safe bet to say we'll be evaluating his progress at some point in the future."], "Dillion Brooks": [" Julian Applebome analyzes Oregon Junior Dillon Brooks, and the impact he has had as a combo forward for one of the top teams in the NCAA.", "Currently posting per 40 averages of 25.8 points, 4.6 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 2.7 made 3 pointers per game has opened up other offensive options for him, and he has shown promise as a powerful straight line driver and high post option.", "His per 40 assist average of 4.9 is a career high as well, and he has shown an improved feel as a playmaking option.", "While Brooks has been a dynamic offensive option throughout the season and has hit big time shots in clutch situations, there are still questions surrounding his transition to the NBA game.", "At 6'7\u0094, he has just decent size for a combo forward type, and lacks the plus length or outstanding athletic ability to make up for it.", "He is a powerful athlete when he has space and momentum to load up, but can be somewhat heavy footed in a crowd or laterally.", "Given his strength and skill set he is a major mismatch at the college level, but will have to improve his overall consistency on the defensive end, as well as his decision making, shot selection and at times questionable demeanor around teammates.", "Despite some of his potential shortcomings, Brooks has proven to be one of the fieriest competitors in college basketball, and has been an ultra important piece all season long for a team with national championship aspirations.", "Julian Applebome is a video analyst for Draft Express.", "Follow him on twitter and check out the Draft Express Video section.", "He will be breaking down the NBA draft in digital format all year long for us.", "Matt Kamalsky Held out of action much of this summer after undergoing foot surgery in July, and expected to miss at least the start of the season, Dillon Brooks' junior year will be a trying one as he attempts to jump back into the mix for the Ducks mid season.", "Coming off an impressive sophomore year that saw him guide Oregon to the Elite Eight and earn a spot on the Pac 12 All Conference first team, averaging 16.8 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game, Brooks figured to be one of the most productive, versatile players on the west coast.", "After flirting with the NBA Draft last spring, it will be interesting to see what kind of strides the talented Canadian can make over an abridged 2016 2017 campaign.", "Besides his lackluster physical tools, there is a lot to like about what Brooks brings to the table, particularly on the offensive end, where his aggressiveness and versatility really shined in Dana Altman's system.", "A capable set shooter who can also push the ball in transition, find the open man, and create a bit one on one from the post and perimeter, Brooks can impact the game in a variety of ways offensively.", "Leading the Ducks in points and assists last year, it will be interesting to see how the team fares in his absence as the confident forward carried the shot creating load for key stretches last season.", "Considering his athletic limitations, Brooks' jump shot will likely play a key role in any success he's able to find at the NBA level.", "However, he's never short on confidence, making timely shots both off the catch and off the dribble last season.", "A 34 shooter from beyond the arc, he has room to improve his consistency, but his 43 shooting on unguarded catch and shoot jump shots and 41 shooting on pull ups in the half court a year ago leave room for optimism.", "The challenge for Brooks has been his bold shot selection and the streaky results they've produced in NCAA and FIBA play.", "Forcing up some questionable, off balance shots, particularly from the mid range, his aggressiveness sometimes plays against him.", "When Brooks' shot is falling, he can be a dangerous scorer at the college level, and though he can be a bit quiet in the scoring column when it is not, he flashes the ability to score in other ways too.", "Very comfortable putting the ball on the floor and attacking off the bounce, Brooks uses his excellent timing to his advantage against slower fours getting to the rim with convincing shot fakes, crafty changes of speed and direction, and a real knack for attacking closeouts.", "That same assertiveness and touch translates nicely to isolation situations in the post and away from the rim at times.", "He's also adept and drawing contact and can score in bunches shooting strong percentage from the line.", "Brooks is a bit of a mixed bag as a passer.", "His ability to create for others from the forward spot is certainly of value to the Ducks who really spaced the floor well last year, but much like his approach to scoring the ball, he can try to do a bit too much at times.", "Posting an even assist to turnover ratio in the half court last season, he tends to be wild, expose the ball when he penetrates, and drive into brick walls at times.", "Despite those shortcomings, he can be one of the most productive offensive players in the country when he's rolling thanks to his scoring instincts and knack for getting others involved.", "Though the 20 year old forward has some things to smooth out on the offensive end, he has far more maturing to do defensively.", "Playing in a zone heavy system, Brooks' deficiencies are masked at times.", "One of the most versatile players in college basketball, Dillon Brooks is a fiery competitor who ticks a number of boxes as a role player for the next level.", "If he can become a little more efficient offensively and use his competitiveness and basketball IQ more effectively on the defensive end, he certainly could hear his name called on draft night in 2017 or 2018.", "Oregon will need another big outing from sophomore Dillon Brooks, who carried them in key moments in the Round of 32 against St. Joe's when their offense broke down.", "The Canadian small forward and Pac 12 leading scorer is one of the most versatile offensive players in the country, capable of making 3 pointers, scoring with his back to the basket, and creating his own shot from the perimeter.", "His short wingspan and average athleticism will likely always render him a second round prospect, but he has a lot to gain with a strong outing on this platform.", "He's rumored to be heavily leaning towards entering this year's draft.", "An interview with Canadian wing Dillon Brooks at the 2015 FIBA U19 World Championship in

with another year of seasoning.", "Still, he will need to improve his lateral quickness to defend penetration, both from perimeter big men and guards when he switches onto pick and rolls.", "One area where Rabb contributes defensively is on the glass by pulling down 9.1 defensive rebounds per 40 minutes.", "He has good fundamentals on the glass by always finding a body to box out before going up and getting the ball with his strong hands to rebound in traffic.", "This is one part of his game he should be able to hang his hat on in the NBA.", "However, after a very underwhelming season showing marginal improvement, scouts have plenty of questions about his role at the next level.", "Rabb can strengthen his draft position with strong showings in the pre draft process against other big men,

Donald's All American in 2014.", "Trimble committed to Maryland very early, in December 2012, and was able to step into a huge role as the lead point guard after the transfer of Seth Allen to Virginia Tech.", "As a freshman, Trimble shouldered a huge offensive load for the Terrapins, and performed admirably, ranking second among all freshman point guards in scoring, only behind current Los Angeles Lakers guard D'Angelo Russell, at 16.2 points per game.", "Standing 6'3, and weighing 192 pounds, Trimble appears to have solid size for the point guard position at the next level, except for his very pedestrian 6'2\u0094 wingspan, which puts him in a club with similarly sized guards such as former Wichita State guard Fred Van Vleet and current Orlando Magic guard Shabazz Napier.", "Trimble featured heavily for the Maryland offense during the 2015 2016 season as both their primary playmaker and scorer, leading the team in both categories with 15.1 points and 4.9 assists per game.", "Being forced to shoulder such an offensive load for the Terrapins has been a balancing act for Trimble, deciphering when he needs to be aggressive as a scorer and when he needs to focus on creating offense for his very talented teammates.", "At this stage of his development it is abundantly clear that Trimble's value is largely based as a shot maker.", "More than half of Trimble's total possessions as a sophomore came in the pick and roll action, per Synergy Sports Technology.", "As a passer in the pick and roll, Trimble is comfortable making kick out passes once he gets into the paint, while also showcasing an ability to make basic drop off passes leading to easy catch and finishes for Maryland's army of bigs.", "At times it appears that Trimble's timing is off as a passer, making passes one or two dribbles too late, forcing his teammates to take contested jump shots.", "A number of what should be simple passes end up being deflected, as Trimble has a tendency to telegraph where he intends to pass, evidenced by his 3.2 turnovers per 40 as a sophomore.", "If Trimble intends to dispel some of the prevailing attitudes towards him, he will need to continue to improve his ability to read tagging defenders and make quick decisions with the ball, trusting his teammates to make shots.", "For Trimble to inspire confidence that he can be a shot making guard at the NBA level, he will need to improve his consistency as a perimeter shooter.", "As a freshman in 2014 2015, Trimble shot the ball particularly well from behind the three point line, converting 41.2 on 4.2 attempts per game, but with an increase in attempts and a greater focus on being a playmaker as a sophomore, he shot only 31.1 on 5.2 attempts per game.", "Trimble's jump shot mechanically is terrific, typically he is on balance, and follows through high while being able to get into his shot very quickly.", "His percentage being as low as it was as a sophomore can likely be attributed to the high degree of difficulty shots that he at times settles for.", "He needs to continue to improve his shot selection and understand the value of open shots versus low percentage, contested shots off the dribble.", "Defensively, Trimble struggles to move his feet laterally, and it appears at times that his huge responsibilities on the offensive end take their toll on his defensive effort, which fluctuates from possession to possession.", "His effort level needs to improve, particularly in pursuing guards in the pick and roll action, where at Maryland he was content to veer late and allow his rim protectors to do the majority of defensive work.", "At the next level, the sheer amount of ball screen actions and the responsibility of the guard to get back in front of the ball handler is magnified.", "With no sign of Trimble's workload lessening as a junior, and Maryland having lost all their starters save for Trimble, it will be interesting to see what kind of season he can turn in, paying particular attention to his potential growth as a point guard and playmaker.", "It will also be key for Trimble to continue to raise his shooting percentages while limiting his

15 years of college basketball.", "Defensively, Morris plays with nice intensity and possesses solid lateral quickness, but his lack of strength is a concern long term.", "He makes some mistakes from time to time like most freshman, whether it is helping or closing out too aggressively, but he played with a desire, especially in the post season, that should help him become a very capable defender

little over a third of the sophomore's shots came in catch and shoot situations a year ago, which he converted at a decent 35 clip.", "A capable shooter from beyond the arc whose mechanics are fairly solid, if a bit rigid and inconsistent on some attempts, Bridges seems to have some upside as a floor spacer if he can clean up his release.", "He was particularly effective shooting the ball from the

Ochefu and Ryan Arcidiacono will open up minutes and shots throughout the rotation, but Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart, Kris Jenkins and Fordham Eric Paschall transfer figure to pick up plenty of that slack.", "Bridges has already proven that he can excel in a small role offensively, so it will be fascinating to see if his skill level blossoms to help fill the void, or if he once again plays a more complementary role.", "If he can improve his shooting from the perimeter, there's little question that he offers intriguing roleplayer potential at this end at the next level, but he could raise his profile considerably if he can flash the ability to create a bit off the bounce and make sound decisions with the ball.", "Though there's some uncertainty as to how things will go offensively for

forwards, something he was asked to do at times.", "Given last season was Bridges's first taste of major college basketball, it will be interesting to see how he progresses on this end in the future

most of his redshirt season to provide valuable minutes for the National Champion Wildcats as a second year freshman.", "As is frequently the case with players in his mold, the coming years will be a major test for him as his role becomes more demanding and he is asked to expand his skill set to become a more productive scoring threat.", "Regardless, Bridges is a player scouts will be monitoring

feet, timing as a shot blocker, intensity and skill level stood out all game long.", "The fact that South Carolina played with two big men almost at all times allowed him to see minutes at both power forward and center alongside Przemek Karnowski, and we'll likely see more of the same against North Carolina who like to do the same.", "While its never wise to react too strongly to a single game, Collins' Final Four performance was as memorable as it gets considering the stakes at hand, and will undoubtedly ease some of the concerns about his lack of polish and readiness to contribute to a NBA team at just 19 years old.", "Collins was having an up and down NCAA Tournament leading into Saturday, struggling to stay out of foul trouble, looking far too sped up at times, and being very mistake prone and reactive to everything that happens on the floor.", "Scouts are still trying to get a better handle on the extent of his toughness and basketball IQ, as he's been inconsistent in those departments throughout the season.", "The intensity and hustle he demonstrated against South Carolina, combined with the sheer number of highlight reel plays he made, will go a long way in easing those concerns, especially if he can find a way to string together another big outing against North Carolina.", "The Tar Heels pound the offensive glass relentlessly and have more frontcourt skill,

signs of budding versatility offensively, contributing in a variety of areas for Louisville in his minutes on the floor.", "He can make a spot up jumper with clean shooting mechanics and reasonable accuracy, converting 7/20 attempts , an indication that his feel for the game is still a work in progress.", "He has some lower body mobility issues that prevent him from sitting down in a low stance and sliding his feet along the perimeter, making him somewhat prone to getting burned off the bounce by smaller and quicker perimeter players.", "Coming up with some strong defensive possessions at times against bigger players, Adel looked far more effective guarding forwards than wing types as a freshman, which could hint at his future role as someone who slides between the 3 and 4 spots.", "Players in this mold who can effectively guard either forward position, while being capable of spacing the floor, attacking a closeout, and making the extra pass, are increasingly popular in today's NBA, so Adel does have a ready made role if he's able to make strides in some of the areas he already showed impressive flashes in.", "A highly engaging young man, with an incredible backstory, having

figured to play a prominent role for Jim Boeheim's newcomer heavy 2016 2017 squad, and that he did, playing as many minutes as almost any player in high major hoops.", "The New York native earned All ACC Honorable Mention honors, averaging 13.2 points and 8.6 rebounds per game on similar per minute numbers to his freshman season, helping the Orange to 19 wins and an NIT berth before opting to declare for the 2017 NBA Draft.", "Lydon's physical profile is a bit of a mixed bag.", "He has solid size for a power forward, standing just under 6'10 in shoes, and possesses an improved 223 pound frame that he clearly worked on coming into the 2016 2017 season, but has a less than impressive 7 foot wingspan and still has room to add strength.", "Lydon was asked to do a bit of everything for Syracuse offensively, helping to stretch the floor as jump shooter, make opportunistic plays around the rim, run the floor in transition, and also exploit mismatches in the post against smaller forwards.", "Averaging a terrific 1.037 points per possession over 12.7 possessions per game as a sophomore, Lydon took a modest step forward from his freshman year and ranked as the second highest volume scorer on a balanced and efficient Syracuse team that did its best work from the perimeter.", "For all of the things Lydon was asked to do, his potential at the next level starts with his terrific spot up jump shooting ability.", "Knocking down 40 of his 245 attempts from beyond the arc in his two years with the Orange, Lydon is a dangerous set shooter with a high release point who has flashed impressive consistency well beyond the NCAA three point line, and a knack for making the most of open opportunities from the perimeter in the half court.", "His ability to space the floor at 6'9 is certainly his most intriguing attribute from an NBA perspective.", "Shooting 7/24 on pull up jumpers in the half court, Lydon's release loses a bit of its fluidity and his accuracy plummets when he's forced to put the ball on the floor at the moment.", "He shows a strong feel for the game moving without the ball and lifting to the perimeter with impressive timing when he sees his defender fall asleep.", "When Lydon did look to force the issue this season, it was frequently in the post where he has fairly rangy footwork and solid touch, but lacks a degree of strength and explosiveness in a crowd to consistently create high percentage looks.", "Lydon's lack of explosiveness off one leg also limits him at times as a finisher.", "Defensively, Lydon has been fairly productive in Syracuse's zone, averaging 1.1 steals and 1.6 blocks per game over 71 games at the college level, and though he possesses terrific instincts and timing, he remains a bit of a mixed bag for the next level.", "Lacking a degree of lateral quickness on the perimeter and physicality and length inside and on the boards, Lydon nonetheless proved to be a very solid team defender playing multiple spots on the back line of Syracuse's zone.", "His defensive potential at the next level is a bit of a question mark as his inconsistent presence on the glass and lack of length to defend the power forward spot could certainly limit him in certain matchups.", "With all that said, Lydon remains an intriguing prospect who still has some room to grow as an offensive weapon, even if he is a year older than most of the players in his class.", "The proliferation of the 3 point shot in the NBA has created a niche for forwards like Lydon who can space the floor and will readily fill a role.", "A potential mid to late first round pick, even with his limitations on both ends, the New Hampton School product could certainly be a nice developmental role player for a team in the 20s who

season, and made three 3 pointers in this particular contest, as he has terrific footwork and shooting mechanics for a player his size.", "Lydon was a lot more aggressive in this game than he's been most of the season.", "His passive play has been frustrating at times to watch, so it was good to see him be more aggressive for a Syracuse team that lacks much in the way of ball handling, perimeter

playing with a maturity beyond his years.", "Operating mostly off the ball last season, with almost half of his possessions coming on spot up or off screen opportunities, Kennard's role revolved principally around his ability to make shots from the perimeter.", "Despite that, he contributed in a variety of ways offensively, as his scoring instincts and skill level frequently allowed him to exploit what defenders gave him in pick and roll and isolation situations.", "Averaging a terrific 1.03 points per possession as a freshman according to Synergy Sports Technology, Kennard was exceptionally efficient as his smart, low mistake style of play translated extremely well to the college game.", "Shooting just 29 from beyond the arc in the month of November and 28 in March, the

Kennard has deep range and the ability to make shots from beyond the arc both off the catch and off the dribble.", "Adept at moving without the ball, Kennard was particularly effective making shots on the move, getting himself open running off of baseline screens, displaying a knack for getting his feet set and shot off before the defense could recover.", "A tremendous free throw shooter who also drilled a number of contested jumpers in isolation situations, Kennard has all the makings of an exceptional shooter down the road, perhaps the most appealing element of his game in projecting him to the NBA level.", "Aside from his ability to make jump shots, its Kennard's instincts that really shined last season.", "Lacking a degree of quickness, but very smooth with the ball in his hands,

read the game allows him to find the open man as a passer, exploit lazy defenders sneaking in to crash the glass, and simply make good decisions.", "Turning the ball over on just 7 of his total possessions last year, Kennard seldom tries to do too much off the dribble.", "As his game matures at the college level, it will be interesting to see what kind of playmaking responsibilities Kennard takes on, as becoming a more capable facilitator in the pick and roll seems like the next logical step in his development.", "As much as there is to like about Kennard's offensive game, there are

with a huge motor, Mathias shows impressive physical tools, playing above the rim with the ease and having great speed in the open court and pick and roll.", "Lessort is a bit undersized for a center and doesnt show the type of scoring range or playmaking ability from someone who might play some power forward, even if his intensity level and length on defense does help ease some of those concerns.", "The way the NBA game is trending will certainly benefit him, as teams are far less reluctant to use 69 centers as in the past, especially one with Lessorts bulk.", "Once the NCAA Tournament comes to a close, NBA teams will likely head to France in great numbers to watch how he finishes his season and compare him with the many big men prospects hell stack up against in the Draft.", "Lessorts season will likely go well into May and possibly June, which will prevent him from doing as many workouts as some teams might hope.", "Considering the role he plays in a strong

Lessort is finally having his breakout year after having moved to Parisian based Nanterre this past summer, where he's getting rave reviews from the coaching staff.", "He's enjoying considerably more

league, and he ranks 1 in per minute offensive rebounding.", "His production thus far dwarfs that of any player under the age of 22 in this league in the past 12 years, including every French player who was drafted during that period.", "Video Analysis: Strengths From a physical standpoint, there's a lot to like about Lessort's profile.", "He has decent size at around 6'9, boasts a NBA ready frame , and possesses a solid 7'1 wingspan that allows him to play slightly bigger than his height.", "He's also a very good athlete, light on his feet, capable of sprinting the court with impressive speed, and being extremely nimble and agile with his movement, enabling him to cover ground on both ends of the floor exceptionally well.", "Lessort is also pretty explosive off two feet, being responsible for some highlight reel caliber finishes this season off pick and roll bounce passes or lobs, often through contact.", "Lessort is scoring at a pretty nice rate this season, averaging almost 18 points per 40, and has been very efficient doing so, converting 63.5 of his 2 point attempts.", "He gets most of his touches via the offensive glass, running the floor in transition, and finishing off pick and rolls and cuts.", "A very physical player, he draws quite a few fouls, but has only converted 56 of his free throw attempts.", "He is at his best executing simple moves and being spoon fed by his guards, as his feel for the game is still work in progress.", "Where Lessort is likely to bring a team the most value in the short term is via his energy defensively and on the glass.", "He brings a high activity level, as well as excellent toughness, and can be quite a playmaker when combined with his strong physical tools, as evidenced by his 1.6 steals, 2.1 blocks and 12.6 rebounds per 40 minutes.", "He regularly beats opposing big men to the offensive glass with his length, quickness and ability to cover ground, and likes to throw his body around.", "Lessort's quick feet and intensity level give him quite a bit of versatility guarding the pick and roll, where he can hedge and recover, switch onto smaller players, and still offer rim protection with his length.", "Still, there is work to be done to become a more disciplined, aware and fundamentally sound player.", "Lessort can be overly aggressive at times, biting on fakes, giving up deep post position, losing his focus off the ball, and committing silly fouls.", "Rim running, high energy big men in Lessort's mold who rebound, finish above the rim and cover ground defensively are becoming increasingly popular in today's NBA, as players like Ed Davis and Tarik Black are demonstrating.", "His upside is limited to a certain extent by his lack of height, age, average skill level and feel for the game, but considering his seemingly strong intangibles, excellent production in Europe this season, and solid track record of French prospects, it's easy to see an NBA team drafting him in the second round, possibly very early on.", "The fact that he has the flexibility to come over right away and play a role on a cheap contract, or be stashed in Europe for a year or two, only adds to his value.", "He has terrific physical attributes but needs to improve his skill level considerably."], "Josh Hart": [" Corey Porter takes a closer look at Villanova wing Josh Hart's performance against

physical tools from a NBA standpoint, a strong NCAA Tournament run will set up Hart nicely going into his senior campaign.", "Named to the Big East's All Freshmen team in 2014 after a very strong first season, Josh Hart took another step forward as a sophomore, being named Big East Sixth Man of the Year.", "Now likely to move into the starting lineup with incumbent wings Dylan Ennis and Darrun

any level.", "Hart's motor paid obvious dividends for him as a freshman in Villanova's undersized lineup.", "Nearly a third of his offensive possessions came in transition or on put backs according to Synergy Sports Technology.", "On the whole he made a tremendous 65.9 of his shots in transition, and 67.4 around the rim in the half court thanks to his timing, elite offensive rebounding ability for a guard, and outstanding body control when looking to convert in close.", "The Sidwell Friends product ranked among the NCAA leaders in two point percentage as a freshman, a space normally reserved for big men living off a diet of catch and finish opportunities.", "Part of Hart's high 2 point percentage can be attributed to how few midrange jump shots he attempted.", "Normally the third or fourth option when he was on the floor, if Hart was taking a jump shot, it was usually a three pointer of the catch and shoot variety.", "The next step in his evolution as a scorer will be improving his jump shot and creating shots off the dribble beyond attacking closeouts.", "Defensively, Hart competes with the same urgency he brings offensively.", "He could stand to get stronger and be a bit more physical defending dribble penetration and fighting through screens, but he has a nice base to build on overall on this end of the floor.", "Hart was among the more efficient freshman role players in college basketball last season, even with his shooting consistency wavering at times.", "His feel for making an impact with his motor is impressive, and while he still has a way to go to

are no such questions regarding his toughness and shot making ability in clutch situations.", "He is a strong lead guard, with a bulldog mentality, and is fearless attacking the basket and drawing contact.", "He can play over aggressively at times and force the issue, but he has shown improvement with his decision making and shot selection as his career moved on.", "He is shooting a career best 50.4 from deep on 4.4 attempts per game, and has become one of the most dangerous shooters in the country, both off the dribble and with his feet set.", "Mason is facing an uphill battle heading towards the NBA Draft because of his size, age, and struggles scoring efficiently inside the arc, but it is hard to look past his overall improvement and consistent dominance in the Big 12.", "He will get plenty of looks in the second round, and even if he goes undrafted, ala Fred Van Vleet or Yogi Ferrell, he certainly will have opportunities to make a roster and show he can play a role as a backup.", "Julian Applebome is a video analyst for Draft Express.", "Follow him on twitter and check out the Draft Express Video section.", "He will be breaking down the NBA draft in digital format all year long for us.", "Jeremy Bauman Frank Mason has come a long way from the fall of 2013, when he was committed to play for Towson in the Colonial Athletic Conference.", "As C. J. Moore of Bleacher Report profiled, Mason was known as more of a scoring guard at the prep level, and never fully adjusted to his role of off the bench combo guard during his freshman season, oftentimes playing alongside starting junior point guard Naadir Tharpe, whose departure from the program in the summer of 2014 created an opportunity for Mason to take control of the team as a sophomore.", "Now a rising senior, Mason has since extinguished any doubts about whether he is capable of being a productive player and floor general against Big 12 competition, as he has morphed into one of Coach Bill Self's most reliable players over the past two seasons.", "The Petersberg, VA native, who started just three games as a freshman, started 62 out of 63 games during his sophomore and

season, which ranked in the 90th percentile amongst all players in college basketball last season.", "At his best when he's in rhythm, Mason is efficient as a shooter off the dribble because he is decisive, low to the ground and catches the defense off guard with his release.", "He has improved as a catch and shoot option during his three seasons at the college level but still has to work on his shot preparation, as he often catches the ball standing straight up before dipping and starting his shooting motion, which wastes valuable time and causes him to rush shots as the defense closes out on him.", "Boasting a 2.1 to 1 career assist to turnover ratio, the rising senior leader is generally a solid good decision maker with keen vision and the willingness to deliver passes to teammates on time and on target in their comfort zones.", "He is unselfish, moving the ball from side to side with speed and precision.", "Extremely fast in transition, the point guard pushes the ball up court in the hopes of creating scoring opportunities for open cutters, perimeter shooters or himself.", "Even though he has developed as a playmaker, Mason needs to take better care of the ball when facing pressure.", "He also must tighten his handle and be more calculated with his dribbles to cut down his turnovers.", "An excellent scorer in the pick and roll, Mason scored 1.017 points per

extremely quick with the ball in his hands and shows the ability to use a variety of dribble moves to find openings.", "A member of the 2016 Big 12 All Defensive Team, the lead guard is especially disruptive because he's capable of pressuring his assignment far from the rim, using his speed and strength to repeatedly turn the ball handler.", "He is a determined competitor with quick hands and anticipation skills, which he has utilized to become an excellent rebounder considering his size, hauling in 136 total defensive rebounds last season .", "Still, there are instances where you would like to see him navigate pick and roll and off ball coverage plays better.", "He needs to move with more force as he fights through screens and gets caught standing straight up as a help side defender.", "When projecting Mason to the point guard position at the NBA level it's tough to see him being a true impact defender because of his limitations in terms of size, wingspan and strength as it feels like he's nearly maximized his potential on this end of the court.", "Mason, who will turn 23 in April, is as an older guard who has improved year over year, and it is crucial for his NBA stock that he continues to produce and progress during his senior season.", "He is a tenacious competitor who has addressed the deficiencies in his game and shown the willingness to improve them thus far.", "Once caught in between positions, Mason has established himself as a floor general for Bill Self and a very successful, winning program over the past two seasons and will enjoy a long

court vision than one would expect, but his 23 turnover rate reflects the fact that sometimes he appears to play as though he does not know his limitations.He is at his best, however, while using his physical tools to his advantage and letting his teammates create opportunities for him.", "Most notably, he is a reliable finisher in transition and does a good job of cutting to the basket.", "He does not have the softest hands, but he is far quicker and more nimble than many collegiate big men and uses his explosiveness and length to make acrobatic plays at the rim look easy.Bell's defensive versatility and overall prowess is what will give him a chance to make a NBA roster and stick long term.", "Few players show the ability to cover ground the way he can, as he displays an excellent combination of lateral quickness, agility and quick twitch explosiveness, which allows him to defend big men, forwards, wings and guards all over the floor, while disrupting passing lanes, and

wingspan, Bell is a mobile, agile power forward who makes an impact with his athleticism.", "Tipping the scales around 220, Bell will need to get stronger in the coming seasons to help him hold his own inside, but he has plenty of time to work on his body in the coming years.Skill wise, Bell is a fairly limited player at this point, seeing most of his touches around the basket and in transition, while not being counted on for scoring regularly in Oregon's offense.", "Capable of playing above the rim and showing nice explosiveness inside, Bell has average footwork and touch and tries to do too much in the air at times.", "He finishes reliably, and flashes some potential as a midrange shooter and face up driver, but doesn't have a reliable means to create for himself at this stage.", "Getting to the line at a low rate, shooting only 50 once he gets there, and showing little post game to speak of, Bell has a long way to go offensively as his skill level is clearly still catching up with his physical tools, even if he surprises you at times with his court vision and passing ability.As a rebounder, Bell is capable on both ends, but could be more aggressive crashing the boards.", "He doesn't appear to have the best instincts, getting by largely on athleticism, and doesn't always seek out bodies to box out, two things he'll have to improve if he's to take the next step as a rebounder.Where Bell does already make contributions is as a shot blocker, an area where he ranked among the top 20 players in the entire country on a per minute basis.", "An extremely aggressive off

while blocking 4.1 shots, Bell can be a bit too aggressive at times defensively, but flashes terrific potential as a rim protector.As an on ball defender, Bell is a bit less successful, as more mature, polished, and stronger post scorers take advantage of his lack of strength and discipline inside.", "He has nice foot speed allowing him to defend smaller players at times on the perimeter, but doesn't have a great grasp of how to use that to his advantage, often finding himself out of position when opposing players look to take him off the bounce.", "At this stage, Bell still has room to grow as a defender, but has a lot of upside on this end of the floor.", "Unlike so many young, fairly raw defensive oriented big men we've seen in the past, Jordan Bell got the opportunity to play significant minutes right away.", "While he wasn't overwhelmingly productive, his inclusion on the Pac 12 All Defensive and All Freshman teams a year ago is telling of how big his role was a year ago.", "Players in his mold can make big, sudden jumps in ability so it makes sense to continue to keep track of his progress to see how he's improving, and despite offseason foot surgery, there's

minutes in seventeen minutes of action per game.Born in Senegal, and only playing basketball for a few years, having crisscrossed the country before landing at UCF, Fall is clearly still at an early stage of his development.", "Fall has a reported wingspan that spans over eight feet, which gives him an elite reach around the rim.", "The rest of his physical tools raise questions about his ability to break into a rotation in the modern NBA, as he lacks a high level of lateral quickness to move in space or a strong frame to carve out space around the rim.", "With the NBA focusing on smaller and quicker lineups, Fall will need to show how he could make his mark at the next level using his size and length, something he has time to do with three years of eligibility remaining.45.9 of Fall's total possessions were logged as post ups by Synergy Sports Technology, but he struggled to score as a freshman at times, even with a clear size advantage.", "Although he is listed at 300 pounds, he doesn't yet have the lower body strength needed to establish position on the block and will use his off arm to push his defender back, which can result in offensive fouls.Once he gets the ball, if he has deep position, he can turn and shoot a hook shot over his defender, but he struggles if he needs to start his move away from the rim.", "His footwork is rudimentary, and when he tries to make a move either with his back to the basket or from a face up position, he often gets off balance and is ineffective.Fall's lack of high level experience was evident as a freshman, as he was somewhat of a black hole at times once receiving the ball, averaging just 0.8 assists compared to 3.7 turnovers per 40 minutes.", "When he did pass out of the post, his passes were inaccurate and his teammates struggled to turn them into points.", "He also has a tendency to clog the lane when looking to post up and will demand the ball even when surrounded by defenders, which can bog down the offense.", "His size helps him score with the back to the basket, but he is by no means a dominant post player at this point and he will need to improve his footwork, passing ability and overall understanding of the game to be a more well rounded post scorer.With that said, Fall is nearly automatic when he catches the ball heading toward the rim, and he converted 74.7 of his shots at the rim according to Synergy Sports Technology.", "His 75 two point field goal percentage ranked third among all players who played at least thirty games last season and he was easily able to finish on baseline cuts or offensive rebounds, as he has solid hands to make easy catches and finishes, and a solid feel for rotating into space to present himself for layups and dunks.Fall averaged 4.1 offensive rebounds per 40 minutes last season, a solid mark, especially for a raw freshman.", "He's not overly explosive off the ground, and can be a step slow when chasing down rebounds that fall outside his area, but his sheer length and size can make him a difference maker at times in this area.He will step out to the perimeter and set a ball screen, but he's slow to roll to the rim, taking a wide line to the rim instead of rolling straight down the paint, which limits his effectiveness out of this play type.", "He would be a prime target for a lob pass with his reach, but he can be slow getting off the ground, and will get knocked off his path by contact.", "While there is no question about Fall's ability to score when he is right at the rim, scouts will be watching to see whether he can expand his offensive game as a sophomore and beyond, which will help him stay effective as the competition level stiffens.Fall rarely left the paint defensively, and was able to focus solely on protecting the rim and rebounding.", "His 5.3 blocks per 40 minutes ranked third in the NCAA last season and while he was able to be a productive shot blocker, he took himself out of plays by biting on ball fakes or trying to block shots that he had no chance to block.", "He also has a tendency to get pushed under the rim when he doesn't engage early, as he seemingly expects to block every shot, which causes him to foul his opponent or give up easy baskets at the rim.Fall's 9.2 defensive rebounds is an impressive mark, and improving his strength and explosiveness could help him progress in this area even more.", "He uses his arms rather than his body to hold off opponents at times, and is only going to get rebounds that fall right to his area when he is in rebounding position.", "If his feel as a shot blocker can improve and he limits the amount of shots he tries to block, he could become a more productive rebounder by being in position to be first to the ball off the rim with his reach.Fall will have a major transition to make at the next level, as he won't be able to camp inside the paint with the NBA defensive three second rules.", "He'll need to get stronger to defend the post consistently and significantly quicker stepping out to the perimeter.", "He was foul prone even in his limited defensive role, averaging almost six fouls per 40 minutes.", "Fall has already shown his value as a shot blocker and rebounder early on, but he'll need to prove he can also contribute as an all around defender to take the next step in his development, especially when asked to move laterally in the half court.Fall demonstrated flashes of impressive prowess around the rim on each end as a freshman, and will be monitored closely to see how he progresses moving forward.", "While his enormous size will keep him on the radar of NBA teams, the soon the be 21 year old Fall will need to prove how he can fit into the modern NBA game in the upcoming years to raise his profile as a draft prospect.", "It's somewhat understandable why Fall is such a raw prospect considering the circuitous route he took to the NCAA, so it will be interesting to monitor his improvement and whether he's able to

strong frame to bounce off opponents and create space to finish with his soft touch.", "Decisive, physical and aggressive with his moves, Hicks gets to the free throw line at a very nice rate in turn.", "Hicks' overall versatility offensively is still a work in progress, as he's not much of a threat to score outside of 15 feet, which is something most NBA teams want their power forward to be able to do these days.", "He almost never looked at the basket even when left wide open on the perimeter last season, only taking one jumper outside of 17 feet according to Synergy Sports Technology.", "His shooting stroke doesn't look convincing at all, with a long and mechanical release, which helps explain his reluctance to fire away even when teams are purposefully not guarding him.", "With that said, he did improve his free throw percentage from 62 to 76 between his sophomore and junior seasons, and demonstrates fairly soft touch overall, so it's possible that this might be something he can continue to develop outside of college.", "Generally speaking, Hicks doesn't appear to be someone you want making a ton of decisions with the ball in his hands, as he can get a little bit out of control when asked to go outside his comfort level.", "He generates almost nothing for teammates .", "Hicks' calling card as a NBA prospect revolves around his energy level and overall versatility he offers on defense.", "He can switch onto any position on the floor and stay in front of players much smaller than him thanks to his quick feet.", "His ability to get in a low stance, cover ground and contest shots on the perimeter at 6'9, 240 pounds is very intriguing in today's NBA.", "On top of that, he's strong enough to hold his ground against most big men, as well as rotate over from the weakside, block shots or take charges.", "He racked up rebounds, steals and blocks at a nice rate.", "His toughness and intensity was a difference maker on a UNC team that had quite a few mouths to feed offensively, and not enough role players at times.", "Hicks has the physical tools and motor to be an excellent defender at the next level as well, but is still working on his discipline, technique, consistency and experience to truly become elite in the college game.", "He loses his focus off the ball, takes poor angles in pick and roll coverages, and is susceptible to biting on fakes, being extremely foul prone at times last year.", "Unlike many seniors, NBA scouts might still feel like they have a lot to learn about Isaiah Hicks going into his last season of college basketball, as he hasn't gotten a huge amount of playing time throughout his career, and seems to be on an upwards trajectory still.", "There is very much a place in today's NBA for versatile big men who can guard all over the floor and be difference makers with their energy level, and it will be interesting to see what kind of progress Hicks is able to make in his last year while finally playing a more featured role.Matt Kamalsky Though Isaiah Hicks didn't stand out over the course of the week, he showed flashes of what type of player he may become down the road.Standing 6'8 with a 6'11 wingspan, Hicks is a lanky power forward who makes an impact with his athleticism and energy.", "Hicks was at his best this week finishing on the break, often receiving the ball at the rim by himself after beating a lackadaisical defender down the floor.", "An explosive leaper, Hicks plays above the rim effortlessly and made some periodic plays on the offensive glass and as a shot blocker on the defensive end over the course of the week.The key to Hicks reaching his potential moving forward will be his ability to improve his offensive skill level and add muscle to his rangy frame.", "He has all the athletic tools to impact the game with his hustle, but will need to develop a face up game, jump shot, or post skills to take his game to the next level.", "A bit of a blank slate on the offensive end at the moment, Hicks doesn't have many bad habits, and it will be interesting to see what his experience under Roy Williams will mold him into in a few years.", "His physical tools could make him a very interesting prospect down the road."], "Allonzo Trier": ["Jacob EisenbergA top 20 recruit in the class of 2015 out of Findlay Prep, Allonzo Trier arrived in Tucson last season with lofty expectations.", "Slotted as one of the team's primary offensive options \u0096 and handed the additional burden of replacing lottery pick Stanley Johnson in the starting lineup \u0096 Trier experienced a predictably up and down freshman year in which he showed flashes of promise as a dynamic scorer but also displayed noticeable shortcomings with basketball IQ and commitment to off ball defense.After electing to forgo testing the NBA Draft waters and return to school, Trier will now look to improve on those shortcomings and further develop as a leader for a revamped Arizona squad.At 6 5 and 199 pounds, Trier has just decent size for his natural off guard position at the next level.", "His 6 6 wingspan isn't particularly impressive either.", "While he would be better suited size wise to the combo guard position in the NBA, his lack of court awareness, underwhelming ball handling skills, and steadfast score first mindset on the offensive end may make that transition challenging.", "Trier showcased an improved physique at the Nike Academy this past July, looking in noticeably better shape, undoubtedly taking advantage of Arizona's lauded strength and conditioning program over the off season.Trier's calling card as an NBA prospect lies in his scoring ability.", "He has a quick first step and an advanced series of crossover combinations that enable him to get into the lane fairly consistently when paired with his aggressive mindset.", "As a freshman, Trier averaged a strong 20.9 points per 40 minutes pace adjusted on a similarly impressive 61 true shooting percentage.", "Trier's success at getting to the free throw line was the key to his efficiency; per 40 minutes pace adjusted, Trier averaged 7.6 free throw attempts and shot an encouraging 79.3 on those attempts.His jumper \u0096 while unorthodox \u0096 has proven to be fairly effective at the college level, but will need further tweaking to find similar results in the NBA.", "He shoots with a low release from his chest.", "The release is fairly slow and the rotation on his shot follows a knuckleball like inconsistent trajectory.", "It's not pretty, but the results were encouraging as a freshman: Trier converted on 49 of 134 than you'd like from a player who offers such little distributing.Trier loves to play isolation ball and earned the moniker \u0093Iso Zo\u0094 from the Wildcats fan base.", "While Synergy only tracked 12 of his possessions coming in isolation, it's fair to say that the percentage was actually significantly higher after accounting for isolation attempts in which he ate up the shot clock before eventually deciding to pass as a last resort.", "It's undeniable that Trier's court vision and ball stopping tendencies will have to improve as he makes the transition to being a role player at the next level.Defensively, Trier has the tools to be an effective perimeter defender at the next level.", "He's quick laterally and embraces assignments against top players in his conference.", "It's no coincidence that Trier had arguably his best defensive showing as a freshman against California, when he matched up against lottery pick Jaylen Brown.Still, as is the case with his offense, Trier's physical talent far surpasses his mental diligence as a defender; he has a bad habit of losing his assignment away from the ball.", "And while he's undeniably active defending on ball, that activity led to foul trouble and a bad habit of over gambling as a freshman.Trier certainly has the talent and make up to play in the NBA.", "The question at this point is whether his understanding of the game will grow commensurate with his abilities.", "Trier showed some immaturity with demeanor as a freshman, frequently complaining to referees about calls.", "Now, following the departures of Ryan Anderson, Gabe York, and Kaleb Tarczewski from the Arizona program, Trier will need to assume more of a leadership role for this freshman laden team.Overall, there's plenty of room for optimism for Trier entering his sophomore year \u0096 especially if you take stories about Trier's work ethic at face value.", "As Sean Miller noted to Tucson.com, \u0093[He's] is the hardest worker I've ever had.", "I have never seen a player work like he has worked in the summer.\u0094It'll be interesting to see how that hard work translates on the court as a sophomore.", "Trier already has enough scoring talent for a team to justifiably take a chance him in the second round of the draft.", "If Trier can show significant progress with the rest of his game, he'll help his draft stock considerably and the Wildcats will be in great shape heading into March.", "Standing 6'4 without shoes with an average 6'6 wingspan, Arizona signee Allonzo Trier tipped the scales at

outlook in a major way in March.", "The skilled Sacramento native has been a key cog in the Wolverines' unlikely Big Ten Tournament Championship, and Sweet 16 run, putting himself firmly on the NBA radar in the process.", "Whether it was the clutch free throws down the stretch of the Oklahoma State win really stood out.", "Here's an in depth look at how Wilson was able to shine against Oklahoma State and Louisville as it relates to his NBA potential:\u00a0\u00a0Although he's very intriguing as a long, rangy stretch four, Wilson also proved that he still has a ways to go before being considered a top flight power forward prospect.", "He managed to grab only five defensive rebounds and dish out only one assist in 76 minutes of action during the first two rounds, and left much to be desired as an interior defender both in terms of physicality and toughness.", "Wilson has been prone to following impressive two or three game stretches with underwhelming performances, and he'll certainly be tested against a versatile, athletic Oregon team on Thursday.", "A big game would help answer some of the questions about Wilson's consistency, while continuing to boost the burgeoning draft stock that likely didn't seem all that realistic when he was an under recruited wing shooter coming off the bench at the AAU ranks.", "The redshirt sophomore Wilson is a fascinating story in his own right, as told yesterday by Nicole Auerbach of USA Today, a late blooming 6'11 athletic big man who blocks shots, makes 3 pointers and finishes impressively around the basket.", "Wilson couldn't get off the bench last year behind an uninspiring cast of big men, but has been an integral part of Michigan's success this season.", "His ability to man the paint defensively and protect the rim from the center position was integral in the first round win against Oklahoma State, especially with the space he creates offensively as a spot up shooter and emphatic cutter, diver and rim runner in transition.", "NBA scouts will be watching closely to see whether he can continue to impact the game on both ends of the floor the way he has at times for Michigan against an array of long and athletic Louisville big men who will test his skinny frame and inconsistent physicality and toughness."], "Sindarius Thornwell": [" NBA scouts will be paying close attention to SEC player of the year Sindarius Thornwell, who is likely the MVP of the NCAA Tournament thus far.", "South Carolina does a great of putting Thornwell in position to score or facilitate with quick actions, be it in the post, coming off screens, with pindowns, in transition, or as a spot up shooter.", "Thornwell's huge frame, outstanding feel for the game, much improved perimeter jumper, and tremendous hustle on both ends of the floor have made him incredibly productive all season, but especially in March thus far.", "His jumper has been falling as consistently as ever, he's been a terror in the open floor, he gets to the free throw line in bundles, and his outstanding rebounding prowess has given South Carolina the ability to utilize him as a deadly face up 4 man option.", "Thornwell's average quickness renders him just a decent option in one on one situations, and he lacks a degree of explosiveness which makes him heavily reliant on drawing contact and getting to the free throw line to stay efficient in the half court.It will be interesting to see how Gonzaga decides to defend him, as their natural small forward option, Jordan Mathews, will likely be severely overmatched.", "The bigger, more athletic and highly physical Johnathan Williams is likely better suited to containing the bowling ball wing/combo forward, but that will make for some difficult cross matches with South Carolina's big men, who showed that they need to be respected in the post.", "Thornwell had another huge game on Friday in a resounding victory over Baylor, making plays all over the floor.", "He hit four of his ten 3 point attempts, and showed an outstanding feel for the game rebounding, coming up with steals, and finding opportunities to attack off the dribble in the half and full court.", "While he's not the quickest or most explosive player around, and isn't someone you want creating a great deal of offense going one on one from behind the 3 point line, he has excellent ball handling skills and finds ways to create space with strength, aggressiveness, change of speeds and polished footwork.", "His unselfishness moving the ball ahead in transition, and making the simple play within the set offense really stood out.", "While his jump shot is highly unconventional, with the excessive amount of side spin he gets on it, he clearly has soft touch, and even found ways to make some pull up jumpers.", "Thornwell will have to deal with a much bigger and longer defender in Devin Robinson, but may see some minutes guarding the highly explosive Kevaughn Allen, who is Florida's best athlete and most dynamic scorer.", "SEC player of the year Sindarius Thornwell willed South Carolina to an improbable upset of Duke in front of a friendly crowd in nearby Greenvile, behind a terrific 24 point, 6 rebound, 5 assist effort.", "The stakes rise even higher as he'll matchup with Baylor wing Ishmail Wainright in Madison Square Garden, in a game that will be watched closely by NBA scouts.", "South Carolina likes to use Thornwell in a variety of ways, operating anywhere from point guard to power forward.", "His powerful first step and chiseled frame make him an ideal candidate for elbow catches, short corner isos, and downhill catches off DHOs, all of which will come in very handy against Baylor's zone defense, which they employ frequently.", "Thornwell is not the quickest or most explosive athlete you'll find in the college ranks, relying heavily on his strength to help overpower weaker defenders and bulldoze his way to the lane and draw fouls.", "He relishes contact around the basket and is a handful for opposing guards or wings to deal with his powerful spin moves and outstanding footwork.", "He's a career 43 2 point shooter, a very poor rate, but makes up for that with his ability to get to the free throw line , as he won't be able to simply bully him like he did to Duke's guards, wings and forwards.", "Will he see any minutes matched up with power forward Johnathan Motley, a chiseled big man with a freakish wingspan?", "Sindarius Thornwell is in the midst of an outstanding senior season, and is fresh off an impressive 29 point, 11 rebound, 3 steal outing against Marquette in the first round, including shooting 3/6 from beyond the arc.", "Thornwell has a lot to gain in a game like this, matching up against the likes of Grayson Allen, Luke Kennard, Matt Jones and possibly Jayson Tatum, where he'll have a huge strength advantage with his chiseled frame.", "Thornwell is a handful to defend at the college level attacking the basket in both the open floor and half court, as he loves contact, draws fouls prolifically, and will finish powerfully around the rim with his length and strength, and it will be interesting to see how Coach K decides to defend him.", "He's just a career 34 3 point shooter, but is knocking down 39 of his attempts as a senior, and forcing him to make jump shots might be Duke's best option considering their lack of size along the interior.Jonathan GivonyThe highest rated recruit to commit to South Carolina since Rolando Howell in 2000, Sindarius Thornwell's decision to \u0093stay home\u0094 was a huge boon for Frank Martin's rebuilding effort.", "Thornwell wanted to play a significant role as a freshman, and did so in a major way, as his 28 usage rate was the third highest among freshmen prospects last season.", "He saw minutes playing both on and off the ball for the Gamecocks, especially once starting point guard and then leading scorer Tyrone Johnson was lost for the remainder of the season with an injury in January.", "Thornwell has good size for a guard, measuring 6 5 1/2 in shoes, with a sturdy 214 pound frame, and a 6 9 wingspan at the Nike Skills Academy this summer.", "He is stronger than he is explosive, with a frame and style of play somewhat reminiscent of Dion Waiters with his ability to simply overpower defenders en route to the basket.", "Thornwell scored at a decent clip as a freshman 18 points per 40, but was extremely inefficient, shooting just 39 from 2 point range, the third lowest rate among returning players in our Top 100 prospect rankings.", "Getting to the line 7 times per 40 minutes helped him salvage some scoring efficiency, but his 51 TS certainly won't blow anyone away and is something scouts will want to see him improve upon as a sophomore.", "While asked to see significant minutes as South Carolina's primary facilitator and clear cut go to guy, Thornwell is a relatively average ball handler at this stage, being primarily a straight line driver who relies heavily on his strength to help create offense.", "His first step is not extraordinary, as he often simply tries to bully his way through defenders, which makes it difficult for him to generate too many clean looks once inside the paint, as he usually has his man still connected to him at the hip.", "Thornwell struggled to score efficiently inside the paint, converting a mediocre 42 of his attempts in the half court in these situations last season.", "He doesn't appear to have great touch around the rim, often looking content just getting inside the paint and then throwing the ball up on the rim hoping for the best.", "Things aren't that much better in the open floor, as he hit just 45 of his field goal attempts in transition situations, a very low rate.", "Part of this is due to his decision making skills, but he's also not terribly explosive, which combined with his inability to blow by defenders at a high rate might make it difficult for him to emerge as a high level slasher at the NBA level unless he improves his ball handling and finishing ability significantly.", "Thornwell did an admirable job trying to execute South Carolina's offense playing out of position at the point guard spot, a role that led to some real growing pains, but will likely benefit his long term development.", "While he's obviously most comfortable looking to score, he made a concerted effort to execute the team's offense and get others involved.", "Not a natural playmaker by any stretch, most of his assists came off simple drive and dish plays or by making the extra pass in the flow of the offense, helping him post a respectable 4 assists per 40 minutes and 24 assist percentage.", "Turnovers were somewhat of an issue as you might expect considering the transition Thornwell was forced to make as a freshman playing out of position in the competitive SEC.", "His 19.1 turnover percentage rated second worst among the 26 returning players classified as guards in our Top 100 prospect rankings.", "As a shooter, Thornwell is somewhat of a mixed bag at this stage, showing clearly defined strengths and weaknesses.", "He is very solid with his feet set, showing good mechanics and a quick release.", "He made 39 of his attempts last season in catch and shoot situations, helping him knock down 37 of his 100 3 point attempts.", "Pulling up off the dribble is where Thornwell tends to struggle, as he converted just 31 of his attempts in these situations.", "Shot selection and decision making are the biggest culprits here, as Thornwell seems to overestimate his shot making ability significantly, regularly settling for tough, contested pull up jumpers in the mid range area, sometimes just a foot or two inside the 3 point line.", "This is part of the reason his 2 point percentage was so low, and it will be interesting to see if his efficiency rises once he isn't forced to shoulder such heavy playmaking and scoring responsibilities.", "Defensively, Thornwell has all the tools to emerge as a solid piece on this end of the floor eventually, with his excellent combination of size, length and strength.", "Unfortunately he's far from that at this stage, as his fundamentals are poor and he lacks the intensity level to compensate for that at the moment.", "Thornwell gets lost defending off the ball frequently, and is regularly caught upright and out of a stance in one on one situations as well.", "He gets blown by off the dribble far too frequently, and doesn't do a great job of fighting through screens, looking a little bit lazy at times in this area.", "The huge amount of offensive responsibility Thornwell was forced to shoulder as a freshman certainly didn't bode well for his efforts on the defensive end, so it will be interesting to see how he evolves here as his career moves on.", "He shows some very nice flashes from time to time, coming up with plenty of steals, blocks and deflections on the perimeter, showing good anticipation skills in the process.", "Thornwell will play a significant role for South Carolina once again as a sophomore, but Frank Martin's team should be better as they return almost their entire rotation from last season.", "Making the NCAA Tournament would likely go a long way in showing scouts that he can translate his talent to winning situation,

out fairly quickly whether or not he can continue to play Briscoe down the stretch of big games with as much of an offensive liability hes become.", "Northern Kentucky may be the type of opponent Briscoe can use to help get his confidence back, because the Wildcats will need to find a third perimeter option they can pair alongside the tremendously gifted freshman duo of Malik Monk and DeAaron Fox.Jeremy BaumanRegarded as a consensus top 15 prospect out of high school, Isaiah Briscoe has long been on the radar of NBA scouts as the result of a productive and winning prep career in which he excelled at St. Benedict's Prep and Roselle Catholic in New Jersey, on the Nike EYBL circuit and as a member of the USA team that won the U18 FIBA Americas tournament in 2014.", "He capped off an impressive prep career with selections to the 2015 McDonald's and Jordan Brand All American games before to departing for his freshman season in Lexington.With accolades come expectations, and though he flashed bursts of potential in his first season, especially as a slasher, creator, defender and rebounder, the combo guard verified that he wasn't yet capable of sinking perimeter shots on a consistent enough basis to take his game to the next level.", "Operating primarily at the small forward position, despite spending most of his life with the ball in his hands, Briscoe struggled to find his spots alongside draft picks Tyler Ulis and Jamal Murray, likely causing him to look somewhat worse than he might have on a team with less talent and a role better suited to his strengths.", "Briscoe wasn't even invited to the 2016 NBA Combine in Chicago, showing just how much his draft stock had fallen by the time to spring came around, leaving him little choice but to return to school rather than risk going undrafted.", "He'll now attempt to show NBA scouts he can diversify his skill set and take on a leadership role for a young Wildcats team, while again trying to showcase his talent with the ball in his hands among a crowded backcourt.", "Powerfully built at 6 3 and 218 pounds, Briscoe has an exceptional 6 9.5 wingspan to go with long and strong hands, wide shoulders and a big frame, all of which makes for an intriguing physical profile from a combo guard.", "He has a strong first step, is particularly tough to stop when he gets a head of steam and changes gears and directions efficiently off the bounce.", "Briscoe relies heavily on his strength at the college level, and plays mostly below the rim from an explosiveness standpoint.", "There is no doubt that shooting remains the biggest weakness in Briscoe's game, as the first year guard made just 5 of his 37 3 point attempts, and 46 of his free throws, contributing to his very poor 46 true shooting percentage, and the fact that opposing teams didn't even pretend to try and defend him on the perimeter by the end of the season, making things very difficult on his teammates.", "His main deficiencies as a shooter are his wide base, rigid upper body, tendency to lean back when rising into his shot and inconsistent release point.", "He does have a knack for finding space to pull up in pick and roll and isolation scenarios, and proved to be capable of making such shots once in a blue moon, but he has a long ways to go in all facets of his jump shot, something that is imperative to fix considering he's not a freakish athlete or a brilliant passer.", "He looked more comfortable as a shooter in the past with the ball in his hands, oftentimes showing the skills and poise to make multiple dribble moves before pulling up, but was unable to show too much in this area last season operating strictly off the ball.At the high school level, Briscoe proved to be far more confident, creative, strong and decisive as a ball handler and playmaker.", "A righty, he's at his best when driving to his left in transition, isolation or in the pick and roll, where he deploys an explosive and rhythmic hang dribble, in and out combo move before using straight line drives, changes of speed and direction, long strides and quality footwork to get into the paint.", "The rising sophomore isn't an explosive above the rim threat, but has some craftiness to compensate, maneuvering to finish with either hand around the rim, though he's more daring with his left.", "As strong of a slasher as he is, Briscoe needs to be more patient creating, absorbing and finish through contact at the rim, along with adding more tricks to his floater game, if he's going to have success at the next level.A solid passer with good vision in drive and dish situations, Briscoe averaged 4 assists per 40 minutes as a freshman.", "His value as an initiator lies in his versatility, as he proved to be an innovative threat passing out of the middle and low post for the Wildcats, along with attacking the pick and roll.", "He can pass with both hands and is equipped with the understanding and capability to hit open perimeter shooters or cutters in stride after driving the baseline.", "As is the case with most freshmen guards, there were times where he should have made the simple decision but instead tried to make a big play.", "He's still working on becoming a more efficient decision maker and further experience should fuel growth.", "A key variable is how well Briscoe meshes with freshman guards De'Aaron Fox and Malik Monk, our number one and three ranked prospects in the SEC.", "Briscoe will have to use the experience he garnered last season to force his way into more extended backcourt minutes and playmaking responsibilities as a sophomore.", "With a 6'9 \u00bd wingspan combined with excellent foot speed, strength and a high motor, Briscoe can defend three positions at the college level and thrives as an on ball and pick and roll defender, as he doesn't mind fighting over the top of a screen when necessary and is willing to take a charge.", "He is active and competitive along with being disruptive in passing lanes and in loose ball situations thanks to his quickness, strong hands and basketball IQ.Off the ball, the lengthy guard needs to be more aware of his surroundings, as he can lose track of the ball or his man, but it's possible for him to recover most times at the college level thanks to his strong close out technique and length.", "A quality rebounder considering his size, Briscoe posted 6.7 rebounds per 40 last season, as he boxes out well and hustles on the glass on both ends.", "Looking forward to the next level, Briscoe has the potential to become an effective option to cover either backcourt position, and his time under John Calipari has clearly made him a significantly better defender, something that was considered a major weakness of his in high school.Briscoe, who will be 21 by the time the 2017 Draft rolls around, should have no shortage of motivation heading into a pivotal sophomore season.", "Taking a healthy step forward as a shooter, playmaker and leader for a Kentucky team with Final Four caliber talent would further establish his potential as a combo guard while enhancing his pro prospects for the next level.Isaiah Briscoe was measured with just 8.5 body fat, which is extremely impressive considering how much of a concern this was for much of his high school career.", "Having lost 14 pounds over the last 6 months since he was measured at the Nike Hoop Summit, Briscoe tipped the scales at an impressive 200 pounds.", "Measuring 6'2.5 in shoes, Briscoe is about an inch off his typical height measurements, but nonetheless has nice size for a point guard, especially when you factor in his 6'8 wingspan, which should allow him to see time defending shooting guards and even small forwards at the college level.", "Briscoe's 37 inch maximum vertical jump and 2015 UK Pro Day best 10.25 second lane agility time are both better than expected.", "Like Murray, he has always been known more for his skill level and aggressiveness than for his athletic ability.", "It will be fascinating to see how Briscoe's trimmed down frame translates to the floor this season.", "His numbers compare favorably to those

touch around the basket.", "While raw and still underdeveloped, his skill level is relatively high for a player his size, as he can attack in a straight line from the high post, or even make mid range jumpers at times, despite his extreme struggles from the free throw line .As the season has moved on, Allen has done a better job of recognizing double teams and finding shooters spotting up on the weakside.", "The lack of shooting and floor balance for Texas has hampered him, as the team lacks much in the way of real wings or forwards that can provide him with more room to operate inside, being one of the worst 3 point shooting teams in college basketball.The fact that Allen doesn't consistently play with a great motor frustrates scouts at times, as he tends to avoid contact and doesn't always bring the same level of toughness and focus from game to game or possession to possession they would like to see.", "His defensive rebounding numbers have been fairly poor, as his awareness is not great at this stage, and he tends to give up deep post position to stronger players.Playing a lot of power forward, Allen has struggled at times on the perimeter against face up players who have a

a physical perspective Iwundu definitely passes the eye test.", "At 6'7\u0094 with a plus wingspan a number which you would like to see much higher given his size and physical profile.", "While he's made significant improvement since arriving on campus at Kansas State, Iwundu can continue to refine his advanced ball handling skills, as he isn't always quite in complete command of the ball on some of his drives to the rim, leading to some very difficult looks.", "He isn't blessed with outstanding touch, nor overwhelming explosiveness, to compensate for this, and tends to favor his right hand even when he's on the left side of the basket.", "Despite Iwundu's unique playmaking skills for a player his size, he has yet to show that he possesses consistent perimeter shooting skills, which significantly limits him in the half court at times.", "As a freshman he made a career high seven 3 pointers on just 17 attempts from deep, but has fallen off drastically the last two seasons, and hit only 12 of his 49 attempts from beyond the arc as a sophomore and junior.", "Iwundu's struggles as a shooting threat are not solely limited to his catch and shoot abilities.", "He shot only 3 for 21 on jumpers off the dribble last season, and showcases mechanics that need serious refinement.", "He releases the ball from the left side of his body, bringing the ball across and often looking extremely off balance on his attempts.", "He appears to lack confidence in his jump shot, opting not to take open looks and rarely being ready to shoot on the catch.", "He was quoted this summer in the media saying he has completely reconstructed his jumper, and has put in significant work on this part of his game, so it will be interesting to see if he gets better results as a senior.", "An improved jump shot would go a long way for Iwundu, if he forces defenses to respect his shooting ability, only opening up more playmaking lanes for the versatile swingman.", "Voted to the 2016 Big 12

40 last season, but also picks up some unnecessary fouls away from the basket which you would like to see him eliminate if he moved his feet more and relied less on his length.", "He shows some lapses

excellent size for a small forward at 6 7 to go along with a long wingspan and a nice frame that should fill out well in time.", "He's a very good athlete on top of that, showing solid quickness, good fluidity, and the ability to get off his feet quickly to attack the rim ferociously with a strong vertical leap.Iwundu is a fairly limited offensive player at this point in time, seeing most of his possessions playing off the ball for Kansas State as somewhat of a hybrid combo forward charged with running the floor in transition, moving off the ball, crashing the offensive glass, and shooting the occasional jump shot.", "He scored a relatively paltry 11 points per 40 minutes, and not on amazing efficiency, but shows some nice sparks of potential at times thanks to his terrific physical profile, soft touch, and solid basketball IQ.", "His quick first step allows him to attack the basket in a straight line when given an open lane, where he can finish with authority or draw fouls at a solid rate, but his rudimentary ball handling skills limit him significantly as a shot creator in the half court.", "His pull up jump shot is rather crude as well, as he made just 4 of his 18 attempts of this nature as a freshman and 63 of his free throw attempts.", "He doesn't force the issue, though, as he appears to be a willing passer with a solid feel for the game.", "Iwundu's jump shot shows potential with his feet set, as he knocked down a handful of catch and shoot jumpers last season in Big 12 play, displaying decent mechanics and nice shooting touch.", "He's still working on becoming more consistent in this area, though, as his release is somewhat on the slow side and he's prone to shooting on the way down at times when rushed.", "He obviously has a ways to go in this area, but shows just enough potential here to lead you to believe he can develop this part of his game in time, something that will play a significant role in how he's perceived as a NBA prospect down the line.", "Iwundu's calling card at the moment revolves around his play on the defensive end, where he's already fairly effective and shows excellent potential to continue to improve.", "His excellent size, length, mobility and timing allows him to guard multiple positions, as he moves his feet well, does a great job staying in front of opponents and contests shots impressively on the perimeter.", "Iwundu needs to get stronger and gain more experience, as he can get taken advantage of at times by older players, but he has all the makings of a very solid and versatile piece on this end of the floor.", "It's a bit early at this stage to be making too many observations about Iwundu's long term potential as a NBA prospect, as he's still making the transition to being a full time wing player

points and 11 rebounder in Florida's 10 point loss a few weeks later.A tremendous athlete with great size and length for a three, Robinson made some impressive plays finishing with his head up around the rim, crashing the boards, and defending multiple positions defensively against a very talented Kentucky team.", "He's shown marked improvement as a set shooter this season as he's emerged as a legitimate floor spacer with a reliable spot up stroke out past the NCAA 3 point line and went 4 6 from deep against the Wildcats.For all the promising flashes Robinson has shown this season, he remains limited as a shot cretor, one of the reasons he went 1 9 inside the arc in Florida's 2nd game against Kentucky when they did a better job chasing him off the line and forcing him to put the ball on the floor.", "He also isn't above some lapses defensively, particualrly when defending off the ball or in ball screen actions, still having some room to grow on that end of the floor.", "Corey

"Devin Robinson is coming off a superb weekend, posting 38 points and 18 rebounds in 64 minutes, while making 4/9 3 point attempts to help Florida advance to Madison Square Garden.", "He has a much bigger challenge on his hands in the form of long armed forwards Nigel Hayes and Vitto Brown, as well as a stalwart interior presence in Ethan Happ.", "Consistency hasn't been the theme of Robinson's career, to say the least, so it will be interesting to see how productive he can be in arguably the biggest stage he's ever played on.", "Scouts are enamored with his size, length, frame, athleticism and the sparks he demonstrates as a shooter and defender.", "With that said, his fundamentals, feel for the game, and intensity have always been dragging behind his pure talent level, and talent evaluators will want to get a better gauge on whether he's actually turning the corner now that he's turned 22 years old, or if last weekend's outburst was a flash in the pan and a product of his physical superiority.", "Jonathan GivonyThe 28 prospect in the 2014 high school class according to the RSCI, Devin Robinson had an uneven freshman campaign, bouncing in and out of Billy Donovan's starting lineup and struggling to be consistently productive or efficient on either end of the floor.", "With Donovan moving on to coach the Oklahoma City Thunder, in came Mike White from Louisiana Tech, who led Florida to an NIT appearance and was able to get a little more out of the enigmatic Robinson as a sophomore.", "Robinson contemplated entering his name in the 2016 Draft to gauge his

the 21 year old Robinson could have used a full off season to work on his body, skill set and feel for the game, all of which have considerable room to grow still.", "Robinson passes the eye test and then some, as he has excellent size and length for the small forward position, to go along with an ideal basketball frame and smooth athleticism.", "His body hasn't filled out quite as much as some may have hoped when he first burst onto the scene at the 2013 adidas EuroCamp, particularly in the lower body, as he has narrow hips and very thin legs and quads that hamper him on both ends of the floor.", "Being unable to work on his lower body all summer was certainly not ideal in that regard.", "Offensively, Robinson operated primarily as a floor spacing combo forward for the Gators, who runs the court in transition and occasionally crashes the offensive glass.", "Almost half of his field goal attempts came from beyond the arc, and he was able to convert a solid 34 of them as sophomore, up from 26 as a freshman.", "His free throw percentage also rose from 64 to 77, which is another indication of his improvement as a perimeter shooter, and a very important factor for his NBA stock.", "Beyond the numbers, Robinson boasts a compact and repeatable shooting stroke with his feet set, and proved to be fairly reliable in catch and shoot situations.", "His form tends to break down somewhat when closely contested or forced to shoot off the dribble, as his release isn't ultra quick, and he doesn't have the most natural touch.Although able to attack closeouts in a straight line, anything more than that is mostly an adventure for Robinson at this stage, as his ball skills are very much a work in progress.", "He struggles to create space for himself in the half court, and doesn't have the ability to get low with the ball, change speeds, directions or hands, or find the open man if the defense rotates towards him.", "A smooth leaper off two feet, Robinson can finish around the basket with authority off cuts or running the floor in transition, but his lack of lower body strength is an issue when trying to use his athleticism around the rim off of one foot in the half court.", "He looks very off balance on many of his attempts inside the paint, crumbling in traffic at the first sign of contact, and not being particularly crafty or creative using the glass.", "His rudimentary ball handling ability doesn't do him too many favors in this area, as when he is able to create a driving angle to the basket, he often has a defender glued to his hip, leading to difficult attempts.", "Robinson's passing ability is also in need of refinement, as he generated just 17 assists in 832 minutes last season, or one every 49 minutes he was on the floor.", "His 4 assist percentage would be considered poor for a center, let alone someone expected to see major minutes on the perimeter.", "To Robinson's credit, he didn't turn the ball over too frequently , as he simply wasn't asked to do much ball handling for the Gators, something that might change somewhat this season as he likely inherits some offensive responsibility from departed combo forward and leading scorer Dorian Finney Smith.", "Defensively, Robinson showed some interesting things at times last year, particularly when tasked with guarding opposing ball handlers, something he can do fairly impressively.", "He can get in a low stance, move his feet fluidly and make it very difficult for smaller players to get their shot off with his length.", "With that said, Robinson has a long ways to go in this area to reach his full potential, as his average combination of technique, awareness and intensity often makes him far less effective than you'd hope.", "He has a tendency to fall asleep at times in his stance, losing his focus off the ball and being a split second late with his reactions, resulting in wide open looks on the perimeter.", "That's part of the reason why Robinson has averaged a paltry 1.0 steals and .9 blocks per 40 thus far in his career, despite his terrific physical tools.", "He also doesn't always fight over the top of screens due to his lack of lower body strength, and can get pushed around mercilessly inside by stronger players.", "Players his size are increasingly used as floor spacing PFs in todays' NBA, but it might be a while until Robinson is able to do so effectively.", "It will be interesting to see what kind of season Robinson is able to put together as an underclassman, as the Gators will certainly be hoping to make a return to the NCAA Tournament after missing out for the last two years.", "They'll need Robinson to make strides on both ends of the floor and show he has the mentality to start to reach the significant potential

basketball.", "Kansas went 31 5 and won the Big 12 in dominant fashion, but bowed out of the NCAA Tournament Elite Eight to Oregon.Jackson's physical profile is a mixed bag.", "He has very good size for the wing at 6'8, and is a quick twitch and highly explosive athlete who plays above the rim with ease and covers ground seamlessly defensively.", "With that said, his small hands, 6'10 wingspan and narrow 207 pound frame may limit his effectiveness playing the small ball power forward role he was so successful filling in college, and the fact that he's an older freshman at 20 years old makes you wonder how much more strength his frame will carry down the line.", "Nevertheless, it is Jackson's defense and overall competitiveness that is one of his most attractive traits.", "He's a fiery guy who has been a two way player his entire career, and showed the ability to guard anywhere from 1 4 in college.", "Jackson takes great pride in his ability to shut down opponents, and does an outstanding job of sitting down in a stance, sliding his feet and locking up players on the perimeter with his lateral quickness, often drawing charges.", "He's a physical player who throws his body around and isn't afraid to mix things up despite his lanky frame.", "Even if he isn't the longest player around, he gets in the passing lanes frequently with his quickness and anticipation skills, and also rebounds and blocks shots prolifically with outstanding timing.", "He'll need to get stronger to handle the bigger and more experienced players he'll encounter at times in the NBA, and is a little spastic at times gambling and getting lost off the ball, but his combination of intensity, athleticism and instincts leaves a great deal of room for optimism in his upside on this end of the floor.", "Offensively, Jackson found quite a bit of success at the college level, scoring 21 points per 40 minutes on solid shooting percentages .", "He's not the most skilled player around, but finds ways to be productive within the team concept by getting out in transition, making spot up jumpers, cutting off the ball, and mixing in timely offensive rebounds and post ups.", "Jackson is a versatile offensive player who shows the ability to be effective operating both on and off the ball, as well as contribute as a scorer or facilitator.", "He has a strong first step attacking closeouts in the half court, or getting downhill in the open floor, using long strides, polished footwork and slithery body control, regularly going coast to coast pushing the ball himself off of defensive rebounds.", "He also shows a nice feel for cutting into open spaces and making himself available for lobs, and has excellent instincts crashing the offensive glass, exploding off two feet and throwing his body around impressively.", "Jackson is a streaky shooter, but really found his rhythm as the season moved on.", "He started the season making just 9 of his first 38 attempts in the first ten weeks, but finished on a blistering note, knocking down 25 of his last 52 tries in the final two months.", "Overall, Jackson made a solid 39 of his catch and shoot jumpers, rising up with good balance, despite his very funky shooting mechanics that may need to be overhauled over time.", "He doesn't shoot the ball the same way attempt to attempt, bringing the ball up from his hip, with his elbow flailing out and releasing it from the outside of his hand without much of a wrist snap, sometimes shooting it on the way down.", "Jackson made just 57 of his free throw attempts this season, and is a career 56 from the line on over 230 attempts in our database, which when combined with his mechanics, leaves a lot of question marks about just how good of a shooter he can become long term.", "Jackson struggled in particular shooting the ball off the dribble in the mid range this season, hitting just 20 of his attempts according to Synergy, which really limited his effectiveness as a shot creator in the half court.", "He made just 28 of his field goal attempts in pick and roll or isolation situations, doing so against collegiate power forwards with three knockdown shooters alongside him.", "Teams drafting a wing player this high in the draft are typically hoping to find someone who can carry a heavy shot creation burden, which Jackson does not appear to be comfortable doing at this early stage in his development.", "His ball skills are somewhat rudimentary, with a high handle and a bit of a wild streak, often picking up his dribble in tough spots in the half court.", "He shows average touch around the basket on finishing attempts off complex moves, partially due to his small hands, narrow frame and the lack of extension he gets around the rim with his just average wingspan.", "His inability to make pull up jumpers consistently hurts him, as defenses like to sag off him and bait him into long 2 pointers, an area of his game he really struggles with at the moment.", "With that said, Jackson shows encouraging flashes of effectiveness creating off the bounce at times, changing gears powerfully in the open court with excellent body control, using shot fakes, driving with his head up, and being highly creative with his ability to find teammates for easy baskets.", "He's a highly unselfish player with impressive court vision who uses both hands and sides of the floor taking advantage of his ability to see over the top of the defense, and can make a variety of types of passes to help facilitate.", "He has as a long way to go to become an efficient and consistent shot creator, but he certainly shows you enough flashes as a freshman to indicate he can improve significantly in time thanks to his athleticism and strong basketball IQ.", "Every NBA team would love to bring into their organization an athletic, unselfish, competitive two way player who loves to do the little things to help win games and makes teammates better.", "Still, there are some red flags they will need to explore before they are ready to pull the trigger.", "Jackson lets his emotions get the best of him at times on and off the court seemingly, as he was involved in a few incidents in his short time in Lawrence that will require some more research.", "His body language leaves something be desired at times, especially with the temper he shows towards referees.", "He struggled with foul trouble in plenty of Kansas' games, and got called for a handful of technical fouls that seemed to indicate he still has some maturing to do.", "Nevertheless, the fact that Jackson wears his heart on his sleeve and plays as hard as he does regardless of the setting or who is in front of him bodes very well for his future.", "This is a trait that NBA teams love about him, as is the fact that he isn't reliant on his scoring ability in order to contribute.", "Even if his offense isn't there on a given night, he always gives you the defense, hustle, rebounding and passing component, which is attractive alongside the right type of players.", "Jackson has a very high floor, and plenty of upside to grow into given his athleticism, basketball IQ, versatility and competitiveness, which should all but guarantee him a spot in the top five of this year's draft.", "Freshmen combo forwards Miles Bridges and Josh Jackson went head to head on Sunday, in what was arguably the best matchup of the weekend for NBA scouts to evaluate from a positional standpoint.", "Both players had strong showings.Jackson and Bridges have been friends since the fifth grade.",

him well.", "Jackson's jump shot is still a major work in progress, however \u0096 28.6 from 3 .", "As has been the case in the past, he's much more comfortable off the dribble than off the catch, and will regularly turn down open looks for tough contested pull ups.", "While he gets solid rotation and has some natural touch, there's unnecessary motion in Jackson's \u0091windup', and it will be interesting to see how he can progress as a shooter at Kansas, as that will be the key to unlocking his NBA potential.", "Jackson's frame hasn't changed all that much, and he also has room to improve his advanced handle on the perimeter, where he's mostly a straight line driver, aside from an occasional crossover and spin move to get to a right handed push shot.", "Lastly, while Jackson's fire is certainly a positive, he can be a bit too emotional in his reactions and allows his passion to get the best of him at times.", "All in all there's plenty to like about Jackson's physical profile, mentality, slashing, defensive impact, and passing ability.", "Jackson's progression as a jump shooter and overall shot creator will end up being the difference between whether he's able to emerge as

Riddell.", "Video Analysis by Ryan Thomson\u00a0After testing the waters for the 2016 NBA Draft before ultimately choosing to return to school for his senior season, Alec Peters was rumoured to be a possible graduate transfer for several high major programs, as his head coach Bryce Drew had left for Vanderbilt.", "Instead, he choose to return to Valparaiso for his final season and has become a strong example of NCAA player development by increasing his production each of his four seasons, culminating in averages of 25.6 points and 11.3 rebounds per 40 minutes on a 60.4 true shooting percentage as a senior.", "His senior season ended unceremoniously, with Peters missing the final four games of the season with a stress fracture in his right leg, resulting in his team losing in the first round of their conference tournament.", "The injury robbed casual fans and NBA scouts of seeing him in the NCAA Tournament, and will likely prevent him from partaking in the pre draft process.", "Still, NBA teams have plenty of film to properly evaluate Peters, with Valparaiso playing a strong out of conference schedule this year against the likes of Kentucky, BYU and Oregon, among others.", "He also had an outstanding showing at the Nike Academy last July, where he was matched up against many of the top players in college basketball, in front of a horde of NBA scouts.", "Here's a closer look at the strengths Peters displayed throughout his time at Valpo:\u00a0Peters' clear cut NBA skill is his shooting potential for his size, as he made 2.7 threes per 40 minutes at a 41.2 clip in his four year career.", "He's an excellent catch and shoot player who is also capable of knocking down shots on the move, as he is able to square his feet and release his shot in one fluid motion off the catch, giving him added value as someone who can come off screens or pick and pop, in addition to spacing the floor as a spot up shooter.", "What will be crucial for Peters in his development is finding ways to score beyond his jump shot, despite his average physical tools and athleticism.", "Measured at 6'9 with an average 6'9.5 wingspan, Peters will have a transition to make in getting his shot off against long armed NBA athletes, especially around the rim.", "He doesn't possess a high level of quickness or explosiveness and combined with his average length, Peters has struggled to be productive around the rim when matched up against NBA caliber defenders.", "With that said, Peters was much more than a jump shooter for Valpo this season, with 44 of his shots coming from post ups or shots around the basket as logged by Synergy Sports Technology.", "While he has finished at an impressive rate of 56.1 on these shots for the entire season, he hasn't converted as easily when matched up against frontcourts that possess NBA length.", "He will need to be craftier with his finishes around the rim to overcome his relative lack of explosiveness and length to find ways to score efficiently around the rim at the next level.", "He is comfortable drawing contact and getting to the line.", "as he averaged 7.6 free throw attempts per 40 minutes, which helped him generate points at the college level, especially with how accurate he is from the line, converting 85 of his free throws in his career.", "There are question marks about how this will translate to NBA settings, though.", "Peters became increasingly comfortable putting the ball on the floor and shooting off the dribble as his college career moved on, even if he still has some strides to make in this area, converting 32.8 of his 64 pull up jumpers according to Synergy Sports Technology.", "He can get to his spots with one or two dribbles before getting his feet under him to get off a good shot from inside the arc, but will need to prove he can be effective against quicker, longer defenders.", "Peters improved his passing considerably as a senior, posting a career high 2.6 assists per 40 minutes last season and 15 assist percentage, displaying his unselfishness and feel for the game as someone who can see the floor and is willing to distribute within the flow of the offense.", "Many of those assists came from a standstill position, and if he can become a better passer on the move, he will have several ways to break down the defense when attacking a hard closeout.", "Here's a closer look at the weaknesses Peters displayed throughout his time at Valpo:\u00a0While Peters' offensive value is crystal clear, the biggest question marks scouts have revolve around his ability to hold his own defensively.", "He may struggle to overcome his lack of elite physical tools defending in one on one situations, as he lacks a degree of lateral quickness staying in front of athletes on the perimeter, and doesn't have great size or length defending bigger players around the basket.", "He was a non factor as a rim protector at the low major level, and has never generated many steals, raising questions about which position he will guard and how he will fare against NBA level athletes.", "On the bright side, he does play well within team defensive principles, and is undoubtedly a competitor.", "He works hard, knows where to be on the court, rotates well, and has a good nose for the ball to help him be first to loose balls and rebounds that fall below the rim.", "His average athleticism may prevent him from being a lockdown defender, but he should be able to pick up team concepts quickly and find ways to contribute on that side of the court with his competitiveness, activity level and solid IQ.", "Peters has been an offensive force at the college level throughout his career, ending his senior season by being the second highest scorer in our top 100.", "NBA teams will surely covet his ability to make shots along with his feel for the game, which will give him an opportunity to carve out a role at the next level.", "Peters is lauded for his outstanding work ethic and has improved each of his four seasons at Valparaiso, which gives him a great chance to stick on an NBA roster long term if he continues to make strides defensively.", "Mike Schmitz takes a closer look at Valparaiso forward Alec Peters's 24 points performance against Oregon.", "The Horizon league preseason Player of Year Peters faced a host of long and athletic frontcourt defenders in this game, making it an ideal evaluation setting for NBA scouts to observe the potential first round pick.", "Mike Schmitz is the video analyst for DraftExpress.", "Follow him on twitter and check out

will be breaking down the NBA draft in digital format all year long for us.Derek BodnerAfter being named to the Horizon League All Newcomer Team during his freshman season, Alec Peters responded by taking another big jump as a sophomore.", "Peters finished his second season at Valparaiso with averages of 16.8 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 1.2 assists per game, which earned him All Conference First Team honors.", "When Peters arrived at Valparaiso, his primary contribution was as a jump shooter, where Peters made 38.3 of his 149 three point attempts during his freshman season.", "That shot continues to be Peters' calling card, as he built upon that strength to become an even more dangerous shooter, knocking down 46.6 of his 178 three point attempts.", "To put in perspective just how prolific of a rate that was, only three players in all of college basketball who attempted at least 150 three point attempts last season did so more efficiently than Peters did.", "Getting Peters open corner threes was an offense in itself for Valparaiso last season, as they did an excellent job of using screens and movement to get Peters shots from this extremely efficient part of the court, and Peters was virtually automatic from the corners.", "Peters moves extremely well off the ball, has impeccable footwork to step into the shot, and has a short, compact, and extremely repeatable shooting motion that allows him to get his shot off quickly and accurately with very little space.", "According to Synergy Sports Technology, Peters shot 42.7 on jump shots overall, which included 44 in catch and shoot situations, 39.4 when shooting off screens, and 35.7 when shooting off the dribble.", "The points per possession those situations yielded was a very low number for a player who used the amount of possessions Peters did.", "With his offensive game expanding and seeing the occasional double team in the post, Peters seemed to make good reads out of these situations.", "While Peters doesn't project to be much of a shot creator at the next level, being placed in a position where he has to make decisions with the ball is always a skill that's worth being developed.", "The NBA is always looking for 6 9 forwards who can stretch the floor, and Peters should be able to do that at any level.", "Where the biggest concern is going to come is on the defensive end, where his physical limitations present themselves with concerning frequency.", "He's engaged on this side of the court, but he's slow to change directions, doesn't move his feet well overall, needs to add considerable strength to hold his ground in the NBA, and isn't quick enough off his feet or with good enough shot blocking instincts to alter shots at the rim.", "These problems are compounded by an upright stance, a habit of biting on pump fakes, and a frequency to find himself off balance on misdirection moves.", "The fact that he's accumulated just 47 steals and 14 blocks in nearly 2000 minutes of action at the college level is a red flag that NBA teams will likely scrutinize.", "Furthermore, Peters isn't a particularly great rebounder on either end of the court, hauling in just 2.5 offensive rebounds and 6.4 defensive rebounds per 40 minutes, pace adjusted.", "Valparaiso was a good defensive rebounding team, with a number of wings who could pinch down and contribute on the defensive glass, which could have impacted Peters' defensive rebounding opportunities.", "Peters does do a pretty good job of putting a body on his man and keeping him off the glass, so this is a concern that could fade over time, but it would be nice to see Peters rebound outside of his area with a little bit more regularity.", "Peters has one certifiable NBA skill in his jump shot, and it's one that absolutely has significant value in today's NBA.", "The diversification Peters showed in his offensive game bodes well for his ability to continue to improve as a player, but improving his strength, quickness, and ball handling, while continuing to make a stronger impact on defense, would go a long way to increasing the chance that Peters hears his name called on draft night when he does put his name in the mix.", "Valparaiso has a much tougher out of conference schedule this season, so Peters will have the chance to prove his worth against a higher level of competition."], "Luke Kornet": [" After a somewhat slow start to the season, partially due to injury, Luke Kornet came on very strong for Vanderbilt in SEC play, winning First Team All Conference honors as well as a spot on the All Defensive team.", "Kornet has yet to develop into the sweet shooting, efficient, 7'1 big man NBA scouts hoped to see him blossom into, with his 3P continuing to hover around 32 after peaking at 41 as a sophomore.", "Still, his size, solid feel for the game, theoretical floor spacing potential and decent instincts defensively give hope he can turn into the type of stretch 5 many NBA teams covet.Against a Northwestern team that isn't especially big, tough, athletic or imposing inside, Kornet should have somewhat of an advantage.Derek BodnerAfter being overlooked for much of his high school career, Luke Kornet's late growth spurt, and some big performances on the AAU circuit, eventually put him on the map as a recruit.", "Kornet eventually settled on Vanderbilt, following in the path of his father, Frank Kornet, who helped lead the Commodores to back to back NCAA tournament appearances in the late 1980's.", "In many respects, Kornet, listed at 7'1\", 250 pounds by Vanderbilt, showed progress as a junior for the Commodores.", "His rebounding, a big weakness in his game up to that point, improved from 6.0 rebounds per 40 minutes, pace adjusted, to 10.9.", "He blocked significantly more shots .", "Still, the season on the whole was slightly disappointing for the 7'1\" Kornet, in large part because of his struggles shooting from the perimeter.", "After connecting on an even 40 of his 125 three point attempts as a sophomore Kornet connected on just 28 as a junior, while taking a step back from the free throw line as well.", "Kornet improved somewhat in the second half of the year, shooting 31.4 from three point range in his last 14 games, compared to just 23.8 in the first 14, but he never truly regained the shooting touch that made him such an intriguing prospect.", "Some of Kornet's struggles from the perimeter can come down to shot selection, as he's more than willing to take contested shots, shots off the dribble, and shots from well beyond the collegiate three point line.", "Despite his struggles last year Kornet has great mechanics on his jump shot and a repeatable, quick shooting motion that should suggest his struggles last year can be overcome, but becoming a little bit more selective in his shot selection would certainly help him in that regard.", "Kornet is mostly an opportunistic scorer outside of jumpers.", "He has solid touch around the basket and moves well without the ball, but he's mostly a below the rim player, despite his size.", "He can score on the occasional post up when he has a size advantage with basic hook shots, but while he's made some minor progress in developing his upper body strength and looks like he has a frame that can continue to fill out, his lower body strength is still a weak point and he struggles to establish decent post position, usually resorting to a low percentage turnaround jump shot rather than forcing his way inside with a move toward the basket.", "Kornet does have some perimeter skills which gives him more than just pick and pop potential, though.", "While he has a slow first step and not much leaping ability, he does have the requisite ball handling skills to put the ball on the floor and attack closeouts, is capable of making quality decisions with the ball and shows an affinity for passing on the perimeter, and is relatively nimble on his feet, even if not all that quick.", "Nobody is going to mistake Kornet for a high level shot creator at the next level, but the skills are there to be able to take advantage of the closeouts he'll receive if he's able to force defenders to respect his jump shot.", "Defensively, it's a little bit harder to project Kornet at the next level.", "While he's able to use his 7'1\" size and length to alter shots around the basket, the rest of his defensive game has quite a bit of way to go before he's not a liability on that end of the floor.Kornet's lack of lower body strength makes it difficult for him to keep even mediocre post scorers from working their way to the basket, and he compounds that with an upright stance and a tendency to not engage until the opponent already has deep post position.", "He can overcome this at times with an occasional block thanks to his length, but his tendency to get pushed around is something that he's going to have to improve upon as he physically matures.", "Kornet also struggles quite a bit on the perimeter, as he's relatively slow of foot, is frequently too upright and off balance, struggles to change direction, and doesn't have the greatest awareness as a defender.", "The combination of his struggles in the post and his inability to defend the perimeter is going to be tough to overcome, as he would be a liability regardless of whether he's defending the power forward or center position at this stage of his career.", "On the plus side, Kornet did make drastic improvements in his output in the defensive glass, grabbing 19.7 of the available defensive rebounds when he was on the court.", "While this was a significant improvement over the 13.2 he grabbed as a sophomore, it's still an average at best figure for a seven footer who was playing near the basket frequently, and his lack of lower body strength once again was a big factor in this facet of the game.", "He gave more consistent effort this past season, but he's still going to struggle to physically compete.", "In some respects, Luke Kornet made a lot of improvements to round out his game this past season.", "Still, when you project out Kornet's role to the NBA, he's going to succeed or fail based on his ability as a jump shooter.", "Injuries and the poor team chemistry Vanderbilt suffered from last year are mitigating factors that likely contributed to the season long slump he endured, and the form, touch, and potential are clearly there for his jump shot.", "If he can continue to develop as an all around player, and regain the shooting touch he showed as a sophomore, he'll stay on the draft radar for a league desperate for big men who can stretch the floor.Kyle Nelson Between his junior and senior seasons in high school, Luke Kornet grew from 6'3 to 6'10.", "Now listed at 7'1, Kornet has developed into a unique commodity, a big man with unlimited range who can also score efficiently around the basket.", "While Kornet emerged as an intriguing, albeit inconsistent player, scouts will be watching to see if he can take the next step forward as a junior alongside of Damion Jones.At 7'1 and 240 pounds with long arms, Kornet has excellent size for either post position.", "The junior big man needs to tone his frame considerably, however, as his 240 pound frame still has a ways to go to reach its full potential, even if he has big shoulders and plenty of room to keep filling out.", "He is not a particularly impressive athlete, either, lacking standout quickness and explosiveness, even if he can exploit matchups with slower footed defenders on the perimeter with highly fluid closeouts.", "Coming off of foot surgery over the summer, just how well Kornet can maximize his physical tools carries significant implications for his professional prospects.Playing mostly a backup role for Vanderbilt, Kornet averaged 16.3 points per 40 minutes pace adjusted and attempted more shots from beyond the arc than he did inside it, which makes perfect sense considering the success he enjoyed on the perimeter.", "Kornet's most intriguing attribute from an NBA perspective is his perimeter shooting ability.", "While his release can still get quicker, he has picture perfect form and range out to the NBA 3 point line.", "Kornet made 40.7 of his 6.8 three point field goal attempts per 40 minutes pace adjusted, standing out as one of the top perimeter shooting big men in our database.", "Kornet looked particularly impressive as a spot up option, ranking in the 99th percentile among college basketball players in those situations according to Synergy Sports Technology.", "Kornet's unlimited range and impressive ability to stretch the floor is a valuable skill worth monitoring moving forward, especially with the NBA's increasing emphasis on having shooters at every position on the floor.Inside of the three point line, Kornet proved to be a mixed bag.", "On the one hand, he made an impressive 62 of his 2 point attempts, including 48.1 of his post up looks and 74 of his non post up shot attempts inside the paint.", "In the post, Kornet demonstrates a soft touch, developing footwork, and a willingness to pass out of trouble.", "On the other hand, stronger defenders easily push him off the block due to his lack of strength and he struggles to finish through contact in traffic.", "While Kornet's strengths, and future obviously lie farther away from the basket, his scouts will want to see him develop other NBA caliber skills on the offensive end of the floor to not render him a one dimensional player.", "He showed some potential as a passer and attacking closeouts in small doses, which are things he can continue to fine tune to add versatility to his game.While Kornet has a clear cut role offensively at the pro level, his ability to hold his own on the other end of the floor remains a question mark.", "His 6.1 rebounds per 40 minutes pace adjusted rank him among the worst rebounding big men in our database, and would put him among the lowest figures ever for a big man draft pick if they continued to hold true.", "His lack of strength and quickness also limits him as a post defender, where stronger offensive players have little trouble backing him down or spinning by him to the basket.", "Furthermore, his subpar foot speed does him few favors guarding the pick and roll or staying in front of offensive players who face him up.", "His size and length do allow him to block 1.9 shots per 40 minutes pace adjusted, but at this point it is hard he has significant work ahead of him before he can be counted on to defend either post position at the next level.Thus, while Kornet is an extremely unique player with his combination of size and shooting touch, he has a long way to maximize his potential as a NBA prospect.", "In the meantime, he must continue to get stronger and improve his rebounding and defense.", "With a more consistent junior season, Luke Kornet should continue to get attention from scouts and has the potential to develop into a legitimate NBA prospect before he is done in Nashville."], "Vince Edwards": ["Josh RiddellVince Edwards has quickly established himself as a key member of the Purdue Boilermakers by starting nearly every game in his two year career, while being a significant contributor to back to back NCAA Tournament teams.", "Edwards is a well rounded offensive contributor as he is the only power five conference player who will return to the NCAA for the 2016 17 season to average 16.5 points, 7.8 rebounds and 4.2 assists per 40 minutes last season.", "Measured at 6'8\u0094 with a 7'0\u0094 wingspan, Edwards has ideal size for the small forward position and with his chiseled 225 pound frame, has the strength to play the power forward spot.", "Athletically, he is just average, lacking a degree of quickness and explosiveness.", "While A.J.", "Hammons has graduated, Purdue still features two prominent big men in Isaac Haas and Caleb Swanigan and are expected to continue to feature them together in lineups.", "This has allowed Edwards to display his versatility by playing both the small forward and power forward spot in various lineups, which has demonstrated to NBA teams that he can be used in different ways at the next level.", "Edwards made a substantial leap in his three point shooting accuracy in his sophomore year, as he saw his percentages rise from 32.6 to 40.7 on 4.7 attempts per 40 minutes.", "There is still a substantial dip in his somewhat mechanical looking jump shot, which can slow his release and renders him more ineffective when closely guarded, but it's encouraging to see an uptick in his overall efficiency.", "If he can replicate his accuracy from the three point line as a junior, and speed up his release somewhat, it will go a long way in proving he can be a credible shooting threat from the perimeter at the NBA level.", "He has displayed some potential as a slasher from the wing, but this area of his skill set is still a work in progress.", "He reads the defense well on drives and recognizes the open areas to find the best possible shot for his teammates or for himself, whether that means passing out early, a pull up jump shot or navigating all the way to the rim.", "He's becoming more adept at getting to his spots off the dribble for a mid range pull up and he converted 43.6 of his 39 jump shots off the dribble according to Synergy Sports Technology, despite not possessing the most fluid looking jumper.", "One area that he will need to improve upon as he develops his attacking game is his ability to finish around the rim in traffic.", "He lacks a quick first step or creative ball handling skills to create separation from his man easily, and doesn't have a ton of explosiveness off the move, which can lead to some tough finishes in the paint.", "He converted just 48.5 of his half court attempts inside the paint last season according to Synergy Sports Technology, a poor rate for his physical profile.", "He was able to get to the line 3.7 times per 40 by using his strong frame to absorb contact which helped his efficiency on dribble penetration, but he will need to find more ways to score off the bounce since he may struggle to finish against NBA length.", "Edwards flashed some skill as a passer by averaging 4.2 assists to 2.4 turnovers per 40.", "He can make the right reads from a standstill by seeing cutters, entering the ball into the post or swinging the ball in the flow of the offense to keep the action moving.", "He started to show some skill as a passer on the move and adding that ability to his arsenal will be the next step in his player development.", "This will help cement his ability to play from the wing as a multi faceted offensive attacker.", "While Edwards took a step forward in demonstrating what roles he can fill on the offensive end, he is still struggling to show off his defensive value, which is a major component of his potential role at the NBA level.", "He does have the physical tools and agility to hold his own against either forward position, but he doesn't always play with the energy needed to make plays, which doesn't work considering he's already at a disadvantage athletically.", "He can switch everything on the perimeter, but he uses this as a crutch to sag way off his man and fails to fight through screens, which allows the offense to move freely.", "He did improve as a defensive rebounder and showed more of a desire to help his team finish plays as a sophomore by averaging 5.2 defensive rebounds per 40.", "However, he failed to produce steals which demonstrates and awareness his lack of aggression on that end.", "He's not a finished product defensively and he will need to develop into a versatile defender by improving his motor while taking more pride in slowing down his man to show his potential as a two way player.", "Edwards will continue to have ample opportunity to round out his skill set from the small forward position in a two big lineup while also being able to play some minutes as a power forward to show off his versatility.", "He will be 20 for the entire season, a young player for his class, and after making some clear improvements to his game as a sophomore after gaining comfort playing in the Big Ten, he will be looking to take another leap as a junior to make a bigger impression with NBA scouts.Jonathan GivonyThe son of longtime European basketball professional Bill Edwards options.", "The Boilermakers will need floor spacing around their old school pivots, and Edwards will need to be able to provide that if they are to be successful while he's on the floor.", "He had a very successful freshman season, but will now need to take the next step in his development and start to make the full time transition out to the small forward position.", "Purdue's Vince Edwards has nice size for a small forward prospect standing 6'8 in shoes with a 7'0 wingspan, and a 225 pound frame.", "Edwards isn't the same caliber of player, but shares some physical similarity with Carmelo Anthony who measured 6'7.5 in shoes with a 7'0 wingspan and 233 pound frame in 2003 coming out of Syracuse."], "Jayson Tatum": ["Scouting Report by Derek Bodner.", "Video Analysis by Mike Schmitz\u00a0Duke freshman Jayson Tatum lived up to the sky high expectations placed upon him by virtue of his status as a top five recruit, finishing with averages of 16.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game for Mike Krzyzewski and the 28 9 Blue Devils.", "Tatum stands just over 6'8\" in shoes, with a 6'11\" wingspan and an upper body that looks as if it can fill out over time as he matures physically.", "He combines that with an advanced, diversified skill level and flashes of two way potential, which makes it easy to see why Tatum has been a top rated prospect all season long.", "Tatum's bread and butter remains his strong isolation game, where nearly a quarter of his possessions came from, according to Synergy Sports Technology.", "Tatum was either too big, too quick, or too skilled for virtually any defender opponents could throw his way, and Duke exploited that whenever they could, particularly as the season moved along.", "Tatum is a very smooth athlete at 6'8\", with a wide array of moves and footwork well beyond what you would typically expect from a prospect who just turned 19 earlier this month.", "Tatum has a full assortment of effective jab steps, crossovers, turnarounds, fadeaways, and in and out dribbles to get his defender off balance and create separation.", "He used this combination of size, quickness, and ability to create separation with devastating effect, especially when guarded by slower power forwards.", "Tatum has added to his arsenal over the last year by diversifying his offensive attack.", "That improvement starts on the perimeter, as Tatum connected on 34.2 of his four three point attempts per game, an encouraging, albeit still inconsistent, addition to his game for a player who struggled from deep at times as a high school prospect.", "Tatum is most effective on the perimeter when he has time to gather himself, as he shot 40.5 on unguarded catch and shoot shots, according to Synergy Sports Technology, most of which were from three point range.", "That form broke down a little bit when rushed, as defensive pressure resulted in some inconsistencies in his balance and shooting motion, and the 29.3 Tatum shot on contested catch and shoot shots ranked in the bottom third of qualified players.", "Shortening his release and speeding it up will likely be a focus for Tatum early on in his career, especially if a team eases him into a role rather than asking him to be a primary initiator from day one.", "Tatum also showed the ability to make shots pulling up off the dribble, especially going to his left, where he was particularly comfortable using one or two rhythm dribbles to generate space.", "This is both a blessing and a curse, as while it allowed Tatum to shoulder a heavier offensive burden for the Blue Devils, he was also a little bit too willing at times to settle for tough, contested, midrange jumpers.", "Nearly 40 of Tatum's non transition field goal attempts came on two point jump shots, according to hoop math.com, which he connected at just a 40.2 rate on, a particularly bad number considering so few of them resulted in fouls drawn.", "Tatum does show the ability to post up when he has a size advantage, a useful skill for a player who figures to bounce between both forward spots depending on his team's scheme and the personnel around him.", "In fact, the 1.303 points per possession Tatum generated ranked in the 99th percentile in terms of efficiency, per Synergy Sports.", "Much of the coordination and footwork that allows Tatum to create separation on the perimeter also shows up on the block, where the 19 year old has an impressive combination of moves over either shoulder.", "Drop steps, fadeaways, and hook shots are all in his arsenal even at this early stage of his career.", "This doesn't expect to be a big part of his game at the next level, but having it as an option to attack mismatches will certainly be something he can exploit from time to time.", "With that said, there is some concern projecting certain aspects of Tatum's offensive game to the next level, most notably his ability to get to the rim against similar athletes.", "Like many tall forwards at the collegiate level, Tatum played a large portion of his minutes at the power forward spot to make way for Duke's deep perimeter attack.", "This afforded Tatum a quickness advantage that may not always be there at the next level.", "Despite Tatum's size and fluidity, he's not an exceptionally explosive athlete by NBA standards, with an average first step that was further slowed down by a high and loose dribble.", "Tatum's skill level, footwork, and ability to change speeds helped him mitigate that, for the most part, at the college level, although even there he settled for more difficult pull ups and floaters than you would have preferred, shots with a high degree of difficulty and a comparatively low expected value.", "Tatum will have to further refine his ball handling and diversify his skill set in order to consistently create efficient shots for himself at a high level in the NBA.", "It would also be beneficial for Tatum if some of his ancillary skills were a little bit more consistent.", "He's gotten better shooting off the dribble, but it's still not at the point where he can consistently create value out of pick and roll sets.", "He's gotten better shooting off the catch but, even with a high release point, still shows inconsistencies in his mechanics, and can be bothered by a strong closeout.", "His handle has improved to the point where he can consistently attack a closeout and utilize some of his advanced footwork, but is still unrefined enough where it slows him down considerably and can be prone to smaller guys digging from the perimeter and forcing turnovers.", "Another area of Tatum's game where he's shown enough progress to generate optimism, but not quite enough to be consistently effective at this stage of his career, is as a passer.", "Tatum has a perplexing combination of, at times, having a score first mentality, then at other times looking like he's seeking out passes that aren't there, forcing down to bigs on high risk dump offs inside.", "At 2.6 assists per 40 minutes, pace adjusted, Tatum flashes the vision and potential to create for his teammates down the line, which is clearly a positive development for a player who wasn't always known for that in the past, but it's an aspect of his game that still doesn't feel fully fleshed out yet, partially due to his ball stopping mentality.", "The defensive side of the court presents many of the same dilemmas in terms of an intriguing base to build upon, but one which isn't yet fully developed.", "Tatum has the size and length to defend either forward spot, and uses his length well to contest shots, close off passing lanes, and harass players on the perimeter.", "He showed marked improvement in these areas as the year moved on, yet his technique can frequently break down, whether that be struggling to close out under control or an inconsistent perimeter stance, making him susceptible to misdirection moves.", "He also struggles defensively in the post, a combination of not engaging the offensive player far enough away from the hoop and doing so with an upright stance, along with a still underdeveloped lower body.", "That last aspect, the development of his core and lower body strength to allow him to play more time in the NBA at the power forward spot, is of considerable interest.", "Tatum collected 7.2 defensive rebounds per 40 minutes, pace adjusted, while blocking 1.4 shots per 40 minutes when adjusting for pace as well.", "If Tatum is able to improve his lower body strength as his frame fills out, continuing to get minutes as a face up power forward is certainly in the cards, and would help maximize some of the strengths we saw from Tatum at the college level, even if the league wide trend in the NBA towards making the power forward spot more of a \"big wing\" might make this advantage not quite as pronounced as it would have been in the past.", "Jayson Tatum remains one of the more unique players in this draft, with an advanced array of offensive moves, high skill level, and a physical profile that affords him considerable potential, and versatility, on the defensive end as well.", "While this keeps Tatum's floor relatively high, there's still some question about exactly what his role will be at the next level.", "Can he continue to hone his offensive game to the point where he can develop into a high level, efficient, shot creator for both himself and his teammates?", "If not, can he continue to refine his off ball skills to be a more consistent shooter on the perimeter, and thus a more effective secondary offensive option?", "These are the questions NBA decision makers will be tasked with figuring out over the next few months as they try to pin down exactly what Tatum's ceiling is.", "Mike Schmitz continues our

high school career that saw him become a McDonald's All American in 2014.", "Trimble committed to Maryland very early, in December 2012, and was able to step into a huge role as the lead point guard after the transfer of Seth Allen to Virginia Tech.As a freshman, Trimble shouldered a huge offensive load for the Terrapins, and performed admirably, ranking second among all freshman point guards in scoring, only behind current Los Angeles Lakers guard D'Angelo Russell, at 16.2 points per game.", "As a sophomore Trimble saw his scoring drop slightly but his assists increase from 3 per game to 4.9, but needs to continue to improve his turnover rate, which at 2.7 per game isn't particularly impressive.", "Trimble elected to put his name in the 2016 NBA draft pool, and competed at the NBA Combine, but wisely chose to return to College Park after a poor showing and lukewarm feedback from NBA teams.", "Standing 6'3, and weighing 192 pounds, Trimble appears to have solid size for the point guard position at the next level, except for his very pedestrian 6'2\u0094 wingspan, which puts him in a club with similarly sized guards such as former Wichita State guard Fred VanVleet and current Orlando Magic guard Shabazz Napier.", "Trimble isn't an explosive vertical athlete at the rim, but shows a natural ability to change speeds on the perimeter and in transition.", "Trimble featured heavily for the Maryland offense during the 2015 2016 season as both their primary playmaker and scorer, leading the team in both categories with 15.1 points and 4.9 assists per game.", "Being forced to shoulder such an offensive load for the Terrapins has been a balancing act for Trimble, deciphering when he needs to be aggressive as a scorer and when he needs to focus on creating offense for his very talented teammates.", "At this stage of his development it is abundantly clear that Trimble's value is largely based as a shot maker.", "More than half of Trimble's total possessions as a sophomore came in the pick and roll action, per Synergy Sports Technology.", "He does a good job of playing with pace and changing speeds, particularly when engaging the defending big, showcasing a great deal of comfort in splitting and snaking against poor defense, but has a tendency to over dribble and make possessions more difficult than they typically should be.", "When Trimble gets his defender hit by the screen he is able to create enough space to step into his pull up jumper or continue into the paint for a floater that he employs quite often, though not always with a high degree of efficiency or accuracy.", "As a finisher inside the paint, Trimble struggles against length due to his poor tools, converting only 50 of his field goal attempts in half court situations, per Synergy Sports Technology, often times relying on creating contact and getting a whistle leading to free throws.", "In the event that the defender is able to avoid contact on the screen, Trimble doesn't have enough burst to get by high level defenders and struggles to create high quality shots.As a passer in the pick and roll, Trimble is comfortable making kick out passes once he gets into the paint, while also showcasing an ability to make basic drop off passes leading to easy catch and finishes for Maryland's army of bigs.", "At times it appears that Trimble's timing is off as a passer, making passes one or two dribbles too late, forcing his teammates to take contested jump shots.", "A number of what should be simple passes end up being deflected, as Trimble has a tendency to telegraph where he intends to pass, evidenced by his 3.2 turnovers per 40 as a sophomore.", "If Trimble intends to dispel some of the prevailing attitudes towards him, he will need to continue to improve his ability to read tagging defenders and make quick decisions with the ball, trusting his teammates to make shots.For Trimble to inspire confidence that he can be a shot making guard at the NBA level, he will need to improve his consistency as a perimeter shooter.", "As a freshman in 2014 2015, Trimble shot the ball particularly well from behind the three point line, converting 41.2 on 4.2 attempts per game, but with an increase in attempts and a greater focus on being a playmaker as a sophomore, he shot only 31.1 on 5.2 attempts per game.", "Trimble's jump shot mechanically is terrific, typically he is on balance, and follows through high while being able to get into his shot very quickly.", "His percentage being as low as it was as a sophomore can likely be attributed to the high degree of difficulty shots that he at times settles for.", "He needs to continue to improve his shot selection and understand the value of open shots versus low percentage, contested shots off the dribble.Defensively, Trimble struggles to move his feet laterally, and it appears at times that his huge responsibilities on the offensive end take their toll on his defensive effort, which fluctuates from possession to possession.", "Trimble averaged 1.5 steals per 40 as a sophomore, but doesn't possess the length that typically accompanies defensive pests with only a 6'2\u0094 wingspan.", "Off the ball, he needs to improve his engagement and awareness, often times playing rigid and upright, not in a stance which puts him at a disadvantage chasing guards off of pin down's and simply being late on close outs.", "Trimble isn't a physical defensive player and struggles to keep bigger, stronger guards in front without being physically over matched.", "His effort level needs to improve, particularly in pursuing guards in the pick and roll action, where at Maryland he was content to veer late and allow his rim protectors to do the majority of defensive work.", "At the next level, the sheer amount of ball screen actions and the responsibility of the guard to get back in front of the ball handler is magnified.With no sign of Trimble's workload lessening as a junior, and Maryland having lost all their starters save for Trimble, it will be interesting to see what kind of season he can turn in, paying particular attention to his potential growth as a point guard and playmaker.", "It will also be key for Trimble to continue to raise his shooting percentages while limiting his turnovers and improve his effort level on the defensive side of the ball.",

tools allow him to do some impressive things at times, as besides sporting a strong frame, he also covers ground extremely well and is quick off his feet to challenge shots at the rim, giving him nice potential to build off.", "He may even be able to step out and guard smaller players in time on the perimeter considering how quick his feet are, but it will take some time and experience to develop this part of his game.", "At the moment Eubanks lacks much in the way of consistent focus, technique and awareness, as he's often a split second late with his rotations trying to protect the rim, getting caught in no man's land while exposing the offensive glass.", "He allows himself to get screened too easily, bites on fakes too frequently, and will need do a better job of bending his knees and getting in a low, defensive stance on the perimeter.", "While he has a nice frame, he wasn't always physical enough with his approach last year, getting pushed around by older and stronger players

35.7, thanks to impressive per 40 pace adjusted averages of 23.5 points, 14.5 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 3.3 steals, and 1.7 blocks.", "At 6'9, Happ is undersized for the Center position he mostly operates from, and will likely need to expand his game somewhat to transition to the pro level.", "Nearly 40 of his touches come with his back to the basket for Wisconsin, an area he's absolutely lethal at in the college game is definitely something to monitor, as he will need to stretch his offensive game when he gets to the pro level.", "Furthermore, scouts will want to get a better feel for his ability to defend power forwards at the NBA level.", "Happ doesn't have the flashiest game and is far from a traditional prospect, but he has great fundamentals, footwork, and instincts on both ends of the floor, and has taken full advantage of the huge role that he is playing for one of the top teams in the country.", "His productivity at the highest levels of college basketball, along with his strong athleticism, basketball IQ and motor certainly give him a chance to carve out a long NBA career.", "Julian Applebome is a video analyst for DraftExpress.", "Follow him on twitter and check

measurables or physical tools and is somewhat stuck between the 4 and the 5 positions.", "His frame is filled out and he has some upper body strength, but he lacks the type of freakish length, explosiveness or speed relative to other power forward sized big men trying to play up as centers.", "However, he possess solid athleticism and nice instincts on both sides of the court while playing with a high level of toughness and aggressiveness that helps him play bigger than his actual size.", "Happ does most of his offensive work around the rim, and converted 54 of his two point attempts last season, despite not being a high flyer.", "He can score with his back to the basket and displayed an array of post moves including quick pivot moves to step past his defender.", "This allows him to start his move from outside the paint and still score as he isn't always strong enough to carve out deep position against defenders of his size.", "Despite his solid frame, he'll have to get stronger to continue to operate inside the paint as much as he does, as he struggles to protect the ball in traffic and turned the ball over a little too frequently.", "While he has some nice skills in the post against college defenders, he's not a dominant post scorer and will need to find other ways to contribute offensively for NBA scouts to have a clearer picture of his role at the next level.", "Happ has excellent hands and can catch nearly every pass that comes his way which has helped him finish around the rim at a rate of 55.1 according to Synergy Sports Technology.", "He does need to improve his ability to finish with his left as he is strictly right hand dominant at this point in his career and seems to go out of his way to avoid using his left hand to dribble or shoot.", "Most of his shots in the flow of the offense stem from baseline cuts as he isn't quick enough to be first down the floor in transition or get to the rim easily out of pick and rolls before the defense can recover.", "Not afraid to mix it up inside, he pulled down 3.6 offensive rebounds per 40 minutes, showing a good nose for the ball and an ability to be first to the missed shot despite not being a great leaper.", "He's also shown a willingness to absorb contact and get to the line by attempting 6.8 free throw attempts per 40 minutes, although he converted on just 64.3 of his attempts from the line.", "Attempting just 13 jump shots as logged by Synergy Sports Technology, Happ doesn't stray far from the paint offensively.", "On the few jumpers he did take, he didn't display a fundamental shooting motion and will have to make substantial improvements to his shot to be effective from the mid range and out.", "He has showed some flashes of potential to put the ball on the ground and being able to create offense from outside the paint will help him become a more well rounded scorer.", "At 6'9, NBA scouts will want to see more offensive versatility from Happ, as he isn't big enough to play the interior oriented center position he mostly operates at for Wisconsin.Defensively, Happ had impressive boxscore production to the tune of 7.8 defensive rebounds, 2.6 steals and 1.3 blocks per 40 minutes.", "This statline was replicated by only four other players last season: NJIT's Tim Coleman, William & Mary's Terry Tarpey, Green Bay's Jordan Fouse, and Boston's Nick Havener.", "He will throw his body around fearlessly, diving and scrapping for every loose ball.", "This does get him into foul trouble as he averaged over four fouls per 40 minutes and he will need to learn to control his aggressive nature to not give up needless fouls, while continuing to play with a high energy level.", "While no one will question his motor, Happ is often too upright as an

his man which led to easy shots.", "He has shown some defensive engagement and activity at times with his 5.2 defensive rebounds, 1.0 steals and 1.1 blocks per 40 minutes but he will need to be more consistent with his defensive intensity to be a dependable defender who can hopefully guard anywhere from 1 4 on switches.Blossomgame's stock was at an all time high in the summer after outstanding

and shot a surprisingly poor percentage pulling up off the dribble against a set defense in limited attempts, two areas to keep an eye on as Morris likely transitions into a much higher usage role as a sophomore.", "A capable passer, Morris averaged 4.9 assists per 40 minutes pace adjusted a year ago despite playing primarily off the ball.", "Lacking great explosiveness, Morris is not a prolific drive and dish threat, but he's an unselfish facilitator in the half court.", "Feeding the post, swinging the ball, and making the simple pass in the two man game, Morris could provide Iowa State with some relief as it looks to replace Kane's dominant presence.", "His passing ability, combined with his tremendous proficiency for avoiding turnovers, helped him post one of the best pure point and assist to turnover ratios for a freshman in the past 15 years of college basketball.", "Defensively, Morris plays with nice intensity and possesses solid lateral quickness, but his lack of strength is a concern long term.", "He makes some mistakes from time to time like most freshman, whether it is helping or closing out too aggressively, but he played with a desire, especially in the post season, that should help him become a very capable defender at the college level.With players like Morris, it's ambitious to look too far past that.", "Playing such heavy minutes but such a small role as a freshman, Morris showed some potentially interesting tools, but he's still a ways away from being a viable draft prospect.", "Nonetheless, he's a player whose growth is worth monitoring."], "Bam

Adebayo is a physical interior presence not unlike NBA player J.J.

undefeated through two games.", "His tremendous frame, athleticism and motor makes him extremely intriguing as a long term NBA prospect, and once his feel for the game and skill level improves, he has

Johnathan Motley emerged as a starter for Baylor, averaging 7.8 points and 4.2 rebounds over 21.4 minutes per game as a redshirt freshman.", "Though Motley struggled at times, he also turned in a number of impressive performances, gaining valuable experience a year ago, while flashing interesting potential.Motley's upside starts with his impressive length and athleticism.", "Our last official measurements taken over 3 years ago between his junior and senior year of high school had him at 6'7.5 with a 200 pound frame and a 7'3.5 wingspan.", "Using his redshirt year to work on his body, Motley is currently listed at 6'9 with a 230 pound frame.", "His wingspan likely hovers around 7'4 or more.", "Though the improvement in the young power forward's frame is unmistakable, he still needs to continue adding muscle as he got pushed around at times a year ago.", "A bouncy, mobile athlete whose length allows him to effortlessly play above the rim, Motley has a nice base of physical tools to build on.Offensively, Motley was asked to play a surprisingly post up heavy role for balanced offensive team that ranks among the more imposing offensive rebounding lineups in recent memory.", "More than one third of his possessions came in one on one situations on the block, as he accounted for almost half of the Bear's total post up possessions according to Synergy Sports Technology, although he only finished as the team's fifth leading scorer.", "Shooting only 36 in the post, Motley did a nice job battling inside, but is still early in his development as a one on one scorer, as his lack of touch, strength, and polished post moves limited his effectiveness.", "He relied heavily on his right handed hook shot, which is still a major work in progress.", "It took Corey Jefferson three years to find his touch and blossom as a post option under Scott Drew, and it will be interesting to see if Motley ultimately follows a similar trajectory.", "Outside of his post game, Motley had some nice moments finishing around the rim, especially in transition where his long strides made him one of the more promising rim running big men in the college game.", "In the half court, Motley struggled a bit with his efficiency as he appeared rushed to get the ball up on the rim at times, and was prone to getting pushed off balance by defenders looking to use his lack of strength against him.", "Shooting just 49.4 as a finisher in the half court, Motley's numbers take a hit because of how frequently the Baylor big men played volleyball on the backboard amongst themselves offensively, but even so, he still has a lot of room to improve his ability to convert consistently inside.Away from the basket, Motley attempted around one jump shot per game, but converted only 25 of his looks from the perimeter and 64 from the line.", "He will need to tighten up his mechanics if he wants to be a weapon from the mid post and beyond.", "He can be a bit turnover prone when he tries to do too much, but also faced quite a few double teams for a player so early in his offensive learning curve.", "At this stage, there's two things Motley does at a high level.", "First, he's a very good offensive rebounder, especially when his motor is running hot.", "His length allows him to get his hands on caroms that other players simply can't at the college level.", "His 4.3 offensive rebounds per 40 minutes pace adjusted is particularly impressive when you consider he's playing alongside Ricardo Gathers, who is arguably the best offensive rebounder in the country.", "Second, Motley is a nice rim protector playing on the side of Baylor's 2 3 zone.", "His length and aggressiveness allowed him to make an impact altering shots at times, but also got him into foul trouble as well.", "Possessing outstanding foot speed for his size, Motley has intriguing defensive potential at the next level even if he won't have played much man to man at Baylor.", "He lacks discipline closing out on the perimeter at times, but changes direction well and could be a standout, multi positional defender down the road if he retains his impressive quickness as he adds strength.Thrown into the fire a freshman, Johnathan Motley performed fairly well for a Baylor team that ultimately fell victim to R.J. Hunter's timely shooting in the NCAA Tournament, even if he was clearly rough around the edges.", "He should play a similar role for the Bears this year as they figure to be a staple of most Top 25

handler, he's quick enough to turn the corner and find teammates while on the move.", "The Cherkasy native was also able to turn several of his 11 rebounds into transition buckets, pushing the ball fluidly up the floor and creating scoring opportunities with no look and behind the back passes.Defensively, Mykhailiuk continued to showcase his improvement as he contained penetration regularly both against isolation and in closeout situations.", "He has quick feet and an improved frame, both of which helped him all camp long.Mykhailiuk's versatile performance didn't come without any miscues, however.", "He has a tendency to go for the homerun play at times and can have brief lapses in his decision making, evident by the six turnovers he committed.", "He also struggled to finish at the rim , with two of those misses coming off of blown dunks.", "While he's a very good leaper in space, Mykhailiuk can improve his ability to take contact in the paint.", "He also had some struggles creating high percentage offense in isolation situations, and proved to be a bit streaky as a shooter for the majority of the camp.With all of that said, it was a refreshing to see Mykhailiuk able to show some of the playmaking skills that excited scouts during the 2014 Nike Hoop Summit practices when he was just 16 years old.", "It remains to be seen whether or not Mykhailiuk will be able to showcase some of those skills in his junior season at Kansas with Frank Mason and Devonte Graham both returning and highly touted freshman wing Josh Jackson coming in, but the Ukranian guard proved that he can bring more to the floor than standing in the corner and shooting up jumpers.", "We have not seen an official roster yet, but NBA teams will be happy to know that Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk is slated to be

the draft process.", "Though his numbers weren't outstanding, he looked as comfortable as we've seen him in some time.", "Defensively, De Paula was a menace, picking up full court and coming up with some superb steals and blocks.", "Making things extremely difficult for the smaller Greek guards, De Paula had a nice showing despite this being his second game of the day and his status as one of the most well traveled prospects in this draft, having been on the road non stop for almost 2 months.George de Paula seems to be taking the opposite route of his teammate in Brazil last season, Bruno

participating at the Combine, and also possibly the most highly touted, George de Paula stepped into a very difficult situation and ended up having a fairly positive performance that will undoubtedly help his draft stock moving forward.", "De Paula was significantly more aggressive than he was in Portland at the Nike Hoop Summit, making some outstanding passes using both sides of the floor, playing at different speeds while showing off slick ball handling skills, strong court vision, and very nice creativity for a 6 6, 18 year old point guard.", "He absolutely towered over any of the opposing point guards he matched up with, which helped him see over the top of the defense and also match up with a few different positions, displaying nice versatility in the process.", "His defense is more potential than actual production right now, as some of the older players were able to take advantage of him with their superior strength and experience, despite trying to be competitive, and he wasn't quite able to figure out how to utilize his tremendous length as much as you might hope considering how physically gifted he is.", "He also had a few moments showing his youth, airballing a 3 pointer and making a few careless passes.", "It would not have surprised anyone if De Paula went into a shell and had a very quiet outing here in Chicago like he did in Portland, but instead he

outside shots, passing the ball effectively in transition, and coming up with a handful of very impressive defensive plays.", "His lack of confidence has been evident, and it's caused him to hesitate badly throughout the week, being a step slow with his passing, passing up open looks to step into a contested one, and look extremely shy and withdrawn from the group.", "Still, the flashes of talent he displays at times is undeniable, particularly on defense, where his incredible physical tools makes him an absolute terror, but also with his shooting and passing as well.", "He seems to know how

make him a player scouts will be keeping a close eye on as he moves into a more prominent role.Measured at 6'6 in shoes with a 7'0.5 wingspan and a 178 pound frame ahead of his senior year at Great Valley HS , the consensus top 100 recruit spent the 2014 2015 on the sidelines as a redshirt working on his body and game.", "Now listed at 6'7 with a 200 pound frame, Bridges has very nice physical tools for a small forward at any level to go along with terrific quickness and solid leaping ability that could improve as his body fills out.", "Bridges's athleticism played a significant role in his success offensively a year ago.", "Though he averaged a solid, but unspectacular 17.2 points per 40 minutes pace adjusted last season, he did so while scoring a tremendous 1.14 points per possession according to Synergy Sports Technology, one of the top 50 marks in all of Division I among rotation players.", "Playing almost exclusively off the ball spotting up on the perimeter, running the floor in transition, and moving without the ball playing off of Villanova's rock solid guard play in the half court, Bridges showed a promising blend of set shooting and dynamic finishing ability.Though only 45 of Bridges's shot attempts came in the immediate vicinity of the rim last season, he shot an outrageous 81 on those attempts.", "The Malvern native isn't the type of player who is going to break his man down off the dribble and make quick decisions to score craftily, as his ball handling and overall shot creating ability is still a work in progress, but he is very much the kind of forward who regularly puts himself in the right place at the right time inside, takes what the defense gives him as a slasher, and looks to finish strong through contact above the rim.", "Doing a very nice job sprinting the floor in transition, crashing the glass, cutting back door in the half court, making hustle plays, and using his rangy strides to get to the rim off of one dribble when the defense gets careless, there's a lot to like about how Bridges handled the small role he played a year ago.Away from the basket, Bridges showed some promise as well, albeit not with the gaudy efficiency numbers he posted in the paint.", "A little over a third of the sophomore's shots came in catch and shoot situations a year ago, which he converted at a decent 35 clip.", "A capable shooter from beyond the arc whose mechanics are fairly solid, if a bit rigid and inconsistent on some attempts, Bridges seems to have some upside as a floor spacer if he can clean up his release.", "He was particularly effective shooting the ball from the right wing, and made 79 of his free throws last season, but struggled from the left side and connected on just 6 of the 20 corner 3s he attempted.", "On top of that, he knocked down only 4 of the 18 pull up jump shots he attempted, as he still has a lot of room to grow as a shot maker from the perimeter.", "The 2016 2017 season will be an interesting one for Bridges, as the departure of Daniel Ochefu and Ryan Arcidiacono will open up minutes and shots throughout the rotation, but Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart, Kris Jenkins and Fordham Eric

this end at the next level, but he could raise his profile considerably if he can flash the ability to create a bit off the bounce and make sound decisions with the ball.Though there's some

players away from the rim, Bridges struggled at times defending off the ball, losing track of his man leading to some avoidable open jump shots.", "He could also stand to get stronger in the hopes of improving his ability to hold position defending power forwards, something he was asked to do at times.", "Given last season was Bridges's first taste of major college basketball, it will be interesting to see how he progresses on this end in the future as he has makings of an impactful, multi positional defender.", "One of the more valuable young roleplayers in the college game a year

threat.", "Regardless, Bridges is a player scouts will be monitoring to see if he can take a significant step forward as a player, as he has the makings of a very promising two way wing if he can improve his jump shot and reach his potential defensively.", "Another player worth keeping an eye on is 6'7 freshman Mikal Bridges, who has shown the ability to guard up to four positions at the college level with his lanky frame and 7'1 wingspan.", "Bridges is not the most skilled offensive player you'll find, but he's shown some promise at times and has been very efficient in the small role

explosiveness, quickness getting off his feet, timing as a shot blocker, intensity and skill level stood out all game long.", "The fact that South Carolina played with two big men almost at all times allowed him to see minutes at both power forward and center alongside Przemek Karnowski, and we'll likely see more of the same against North Carolina who like to do the same.While its never wise to react too strongly to a single game, Collins' Final Four performance was as memorable as it gets considering the stakes at hand, and will undoubtedly ease some of the concerns about his lack of polish

and severely limited his playing time until late in the ACC slate at the end of February.Taking advantage of a full summer at Louisville to work on his body and skill level, Adel responded with a strong showing at the adidas Nations camp in Los Angeles in August, ranking as the most productive collegiate player at the event.With Louisville's top three scorers off to the pro ranks, Adel will be asked to shoulder a much more important role as a sophomore, which should tell us quite a bit more about the type of long term prospect he is.As a freshman, Adel averaged just 4 points and 2.1 rebounds in 12 minutes per game, although his minutes did increase to 22 per game over the last five contests of the season, which were somewhat meaningless for Louisville due to their self imposed postseason ban.", "Those 111 minutes in five competitive ACC games down the stretch allowed him to get him some much needed experience heading into his sophomore season, and helped scouts get a decent feel for what his strengths and weaknesses are as a prospect.Standing 6'7, 200 pounds, Adel has a solid physical profile for a small forward, with good size and a frame that should fill out nicely in time.", "His wingspan is just average, measured 6'9 \u00bd at the Nike Skills Academy in 2014, and he doesn't compensate for that with freakish quickness or explosiveness, but he's a solid overall athlete for his position.", "Adel shows signs of budding versatility offensively, contributing in a variety of areas for Louisville in his minutes on the floor.", "He can make a spot up jumper with clean shooting mechanics and reasonable accuracy, converting 7/20 attempts , an indication that his feel for the game is still a work in progress.", "He has some lower body mobility issues that prevent him from sitting down in a low stance and sliding his feet along the perimeter, making him somewhat prone to getting burned off the bounce by smaller and quicker perimeter players.", "Coming up with some strong defensive possessions at times against bigger players, Adel looked far more effective guarding forwards than wing types as a freshman, which could hint at his future role as someone who slides between the 3 and 4 spots.", "Players in this mold who can effectively guard either forward position, while being capable of spacing the floor, attacking a closeout, and making the extra pass, are increasingly popular in today's NBA, so Adel does have a ready made role if he's able to make strides in some of the areas he already showed impressive flashes in.", "At the moment, it's not quite clear what Adel hangs his hat on a prospect, as he's not elite in any one facet of the game, but that will be much easier to gauge with a full season to evaluate him.", "A highly engaging young man, with an incredible backstory, having fled war torn Sudan for Australia, by way of Uganda, Adel will have no shortage of fans in many different countries cheering him on every step

seniors in college basketball, Hill has still yet to turn 21, while other players in his class on our mock draft are already 23, and some will even turn 24 during the season.", "The fact that he won't be 22 virtually until opening day of the 2017 NBA season indicates he easily could have been a member of the junior class but elected to start college a year early.", "Hill isn't blessed with elite physical tools, measured just 6'5 \u00bd in shoes with a fairly pedestrian 6'8 \u00bd wingspan for a small forward.", "He's not an exceptional athlete on top of that, lacking overwhelming quickness or

around the rim.", "Hill isn't a great passer and doesn't have the court awareness yet to see his open teammates when he has the ball in his hands.", "The good news is that he doesn't turn the ball over that much at just 1.9 per 40 minutes pace adjusted.", "This is caused more by his lack of playmaking ability than an ability to hold onto the ball, as he doesn't look to create for his teammates on a regular basis.", "Defensively, Hill projects to be a competent defender in the right situation but he still has room to grow on this end of the court before he becomes someone who can be relied upon against NBA wings.", "His average wingspan is a cause for concern, as he will struggle to challenge shots both on the perimeter and near the basket.", "He can move his feet well in the half court to cut off dribble penetration which will help him slow down wings or funnel them to the right areas on the floor.", "He does get muscled out of the way at times operating at the 4 spot, but that should decrease as he adds strength to his frame.", "He is still learning how to defend in a team scheme, as he sometimes gets lost in his individual matchup and fails to see the whole play develop

effectively and needs to make smarter decisions on the defensive side of the ball to help the team.", "He looks like a useful defensive player individually but will have to increase his court awareness to become an all around defender.", "A year younger than his classmates, Hill is brimming with NBA potential.", "He's already demonstrated he can shoot the ball and he will have a larger

savvy, and advanced moves that he's working toward as he continues to develop.", "Bradley also features a shooting stroke that he should be able to extend to at least mid range spots in time.", "The ball comes out of his hand nicely, and given his solid mechanics, his touch should translate to his jumper with additional reps.", "Although he may not have monster upside given his body type and lack

year old and underwent athletic testing, but wasn't weighed or measured.", "Standing 7'1.25 in shoes with a strong 250 pound frame and a decent 7'2.25 wingspan, the 18 year old has tremendous size for

his back to the basket, something he showed brief glimpses of in this game.", "His combination of size, relatively big frame for his age and mobility allows him to be a presence on the offensive glass, and he came up with three offensive rebounds in this contest, something scouts want to see him do more consistently.While he's physically mature for his age, he's still just a teenager in terms of pure strength, something that was noticeable at times in this game, which he'll have to continue to address at the pro level.", "Playing against men, Hartenstein isn't always able to finish through

to make it as difficult as possible for his man leading up to the catch, opponents have an easy time shooting over him as they can catch and shoot over his closeouts or rise above him on pull ups.", "He also doesn't have the elite lateral quickness and long strides needed to stay in front of dribble penetration and he lacks a high level of defensive upside and versatility that could prevent him from being a two way contributor as a starter.Never one to back down from a challenge, Evans will hope to join a list of six foot and under point guards who heard their name called on draft night including Tyler Ulis, Kay Felder, Isaiah Thomas, andShane Larkin among others.", "These types of players have an uphill to make an impact at the next level, but there is a strong precedent for success that Evans will be looking to replicate.Evans' intangibles will go a long way in helping him, as he's universally lauded for his character and work ethic, which is often the difference maker in players in his mold.", "Julian Applebome analyzes the head to head point guard matchup between Maryland's Melo Trimble and Oklahoma State's Jawun Evans, from an NBA Draft perspective.The two highly touted point guards did not see very many possessions matched up with each other unfortunately, as both coaches preferred to keep their star ball handlers out of foul trouble and well rested for their

his 3 point attempts last year, but attempted less than two per game.", "He actually shows some potential in this area, though, as he has natural touch and shooting mechanics, as well as the ability to make jumpers both with his feet set and off the dribble, which leaves a lot of room for optimism in this area.", "The fact that he shot 83 from the free throw line is encouraging as well.", "Like many young players, Evans is still working on becoming more consistent with this part of his game, as he has a tendency to kick his legs out or contort his body sideways unnecessarily on many of his attempt, leading to poor balance.", "He sometimes holds the ball for too long and in turn shoots his jumper on the way down as well.", "Defensively, Evans shows nice competitiveness, strong fundamentals, and didn't appear to use his outsized role on offense as an excuse to take plays off on the other end of the floor.", "He has some peskiness to him and likes to get up on shooters and

a huge rate for someone his size.", "He gets in the passing lanes at a nice rate as well.", "With that said, Evans still has work to do on this end of the floor as well.", "He doesn't have elite lateral quickness, and wasn't immune from getting blown by off the dribble at times last year.", "He also will fall asleep at times in his stance off the ball when his teammate appears to be out of the play, losing his focus and making him a target for backscreens or cuts.", "Evans had a strong freshman season, accentuated by the 42 points he put up in a narrow loss to Oklahoma, a team that eventually went on to make the Final Four.", "With the Big 12 seemingly taking a step back this season, having lost quite a bit of talent to graduation and the NBA Draft, it will be interesting to see

consensus top 75 prospect in the high school class of 2015 coming out of New Hampton Prep, Tyler Lydon played a significant role averaging 10.1 points and 6.3 rebounds per game coming off the bench as a freshman for a Syracuse team that turned things around late and made an unexpected run to the Final Four.", "One of the more highly regarded returning prospects in the ACC, Lydon figured to play a prominent role for Jim Boeheim's newcomer heavy 2016 2017 squad, and that he did, playing as many minutes as almost any player in high major hoops.", "The New York native earned All ACC Honorable Mention honors, averaging 13.2 points and 8.6 rebounds per game on similar per minute numbers to his freshman season, helping the Orange to 19 wins and an NIT berth before opting to declare for the 2017 NBA Draft.", "Lydon's physical profile is a bit of a mixed bag.", "He has solid size for a power forward, standing just under 6'10 in shoes, and possesses an improved 223 pound frame that he clearly worked on coming into the 2016 2017 season, but has a less than impressive 7 foot wingspan and still has room to add strength.", "A fluid athlete, Lydon isn't overwhelmingly shifty with the ball in his hands, but runs the floor well and is quick off two feet when he can build up a head of steam approaching the basket.", "Lydon was asked to do a bit of everything for Syracuse offensively, helping to stretch the floor as jump shooter, make opportunistic plays around the rim, run the floor in transition, and also exploit mismatches in the post against smaller forwards.", "Averaging a terrific 1.037 points per possession over 12.7 possessions per game as a sophomore, Lydon took a modest step forward from his freshman year and ranked as the second highest volume scorer on a balanced and efficient Syracuse team that did its best work from the perimeter.", "However, Lydon's 14.9 points per 40 minutes pace adjusted ranks as the fifth lowest mark among college players in our top 100, as he didn't always assert himself as well some nights as others, never really emerging as the go to guy Syracuse fans hoped he'd develop into.", "For all of the things Lydon was asked to do, his potential at the next level starts with his terrific spot up jump shooting ability.", "Knocking down 40 of his 245 attempts from beyond the arc in his two years with the Orange, Lydon is a dangerous set shooter with a high release point who has flashed impressive consistency well beyond the NCAA three point line, and a knack for making the most of open opportunities from the perimeter in the half court.", "His ability to space the floor at 6'9 is certainly his most intriguing attribute from an NBA perspective.", "As well as Lydon shoots the ball off the catch, he's not nearly as effective off the dribble.", "Shooting 7/24 on pull up jumpers in the half court, Lydon's release loses a bit of its fluidity and his accuracy plummets when he's forced to put the ball on the floor at the moment.", "He isn't particularly quick or elusive off the bounce, limiting his ability to create separation one on one and rendering him more of an off ball threat.", "Though Lydon isn't very adept at creating offense away from the rim, to his credit, he does a very nice job relocating without the ball in his hands.", "He shows a strong feel for the game moving without the ball and lifting to the perimeter with impressive timing when he sees his defender fall asleep.", "The 20 year old is also solid passer who keeps his head up when he puts the ball on the floor, and doesn't force many shots, sometimes to a fault.", "When Lydon did look to force the issue this season, it was frequently in the post where he has fairly rangy footwork and solid touch, but lacks a degree of strength and explosiveness in a crowd to consistently create high percentage looks.", "Lydon's lack of explosiveness off one leg also limits him at times as a finisher.", "Shooting a slightly above average 56 in finishing situations in the half court last season, Lydon can go up and get lobs and play well above rim when he crashes the boards with a head of steam, but isn't quite as capable when forced to play through contact, even actively avoiding it at times.", "Defensively, Lydon has been fairly productive in Syracuse's zone, averaging 1.1 steals and 1.6 blocks per game over 71 games at the college level, and though he possesses terrific instincts and timing, he remains a bit of a mixed bag for the next level.", "Lacking a degree of lateral quickness on the perimeter and physicality and length inside and on the boards, Lydon nonetheless proved to be a very solid team defender playing multiple spots on the back line of Syracuse's zone.", "His defensive potential at the next level is a bit of a question mark as his inconsistent presence on the glass and lack of length to defend the power forward spot could certainly limit him in certain matchups.", "With all that said, Lydon remains an intriguing prospect who still has some room to grow as an offensive weapon, even if he is a year older than most of the players in his class.", "The proliferation of the 3 point shot in the NBA has created a niche for forwards like Lydon who can space the floor and will readily fill a role.", "A potential mid to late first round pick, even with his limitations on both ends, the New Hampton School product could certainly be a nice developmental role player for a team in the 20s who can mask his weaknesses and make use of the valuable floor spacing he figures to provide.", "Ryan Thomson takes a closer look at Syracuse power forward Tyler Lydon's performance against Georgetown.The 6'9 sophomore had arguably his best game at the college level, finishing with a very strong 29 points and 9 rebounds in 36 minutes, shooting 12 13 from the field and two of five from the free throw line.", "He's been off to a slow start offensively in what was projected to be a breakout season after a very promising freshman campaign.", "With that said, he's still shooting 41 for 3 on the season, and made three 3 pointers in this particular contest, as he has terrific footwork and shooting mechanics for a player his size.Lydon was a lot more aggressive in this game than he's been most of the season.", "His passive play has been frustrating at times to watch, so it was good to see him be more aggressive for a Syracuse team that lacks much in the way of ball handling, perimeter shooting, and overall talent this season.Lydon showed off his playmaking skills, post game, off ball movement, and all around feel

rebounds, and 1.5 assists over 26.7 minutes per game, Kennard figures to play a prominent role for Mike Krzyzewski's program for the foreseeable future, and ultimately find his way onto the NBA

"Measured around 6'6 in shoes with a mediocre 6'5 wingspan and 187 pound frame at the 2015 Nike Hoop Summit, Kennard has average tools for a shooting guard.", "To his credit, the 20 year old had made noticeable strides adding muscle to his frame by the end of last season and comes into the 2016 season listed at 202 pounds.", "Lacking a degree of quickness defensively and the explosiveness to play above the rim without significant room to operate, Kennard's poor length and average athleticism are the biggest concerns regarding his NBA potential.", "What Kennard lacks in physical tools he makes up for with tremendous instincts and polish, playing with a maturity beyond his years.", "Operating mostly off the ball last season, with almost half of his possessions coming on spot up or off screen opportunities, Kennard's role revolved principally around his ability to make shots from the perimeter.", "Despite that, he contributed in a variety of ways offensively, as his scoring instincts and skill level frequently allowed him to exploit what defenders gave him in pick and roll and isolation situations.", "Averaging a terrific 1.03 points per possession as a freshman according to Synergy Sports Technology, Kennard was exceptionally efficient as his smart, low mistake style of play translated extremely well to the college game.As good as Kennard's season looked on paper, it wasn't without its difficult stretches.", "Shooting just 29 from beyond the arc in the month of November and 28 in March, the Franklin, Ohio native suffered through a number of cold streaks from deep,

knack for getting his feet set and shot off before the defense could recover.", "A tremendous free throw shooter who also drilled a number of contested jumpers in isolation situations, Kennard has all the makings of an exceptional shooter down the road, perhaps the most appealing element of his game in projecting him to the NBA level.Aside from his ability to make jump shots, its Kennard's instincts that really shined last season.", "Lacking a degree of quickness, but very smooth with the ball in his hands, Kennard is an opportunistic slasher who uses quick jabs, savvy footwork, and timely fakes to create space for himself to score inside.", "Shooting an average 51 around the rim in the half court in finishing situations, but tossing in 54 of his floaters flashing good touch scoring with both hands, Kennard isn't very shifty with the ball and plays mostly below the rim, making it difficult for him to finish in traffic, but still finds ways to contribute attacking off the dribble.Aside from his ability to score the ball, Kennard's ability to read the game allows him to find the open man as a passer, exploit lazy defenders sneaking in to crash the glass, and simply make good decisions.", "Turning the ball over on just 7 of his total possessions last year, Kennard seldom tries to do too much off the dribble.", "As his game matures at the college level, it will be interesting to see what kind of playmaking responsibilities Kennard takes on, as becoming a more capable facilitator in the pick and roll seems like the next logical step in his development.", "As much as there is to like about Kennard's offensive game, there are considerable concerns about his defensive ability.", "Consistently targeted by opposing coaches, Kennard's lack of length and lateral speed overshadowed his quick hands and the solid energy level he played with last season.", "Struggling to keep the ball in front of him at times and lacking the ability to bother shooters, Kennard

to draw some early impressions of how things have gone for Ferguson thus far.", "On paper, Ferguson hasn't been an incredibly impactful player thus far, which was to be expected to some extent for those familiar with him.", "He's averaging 6.3 rebounds in 18 minutes per game, shooting 45 for 2, 39 for 3 and 58 from the free throw line, while generating very few assists, rebounds, steals, blocks or free throw attempts.", "The film tells somewhat of a different story, though, as he's very clearly carved out an important role over the past six weeks or so.", "Now on a three game winning streak, Adelaide, at 6 6, is just a game and a half out of first place.", "Ferguson is even getting some crunch time minutes in highly competitive games, and the coaching staff clearly has a role for him that he's very much bought into.", "He seems to be gaining more of a comfort level as the season moves on, and could be in line for a much stronger finish if he doesn't hit the proverbial rookie wall.", "Offensively, Ferguson is mostly a spot up shooter, which has always been his strong point, and will almost certainly continue to be his role at the NBA level as well.", "What's impressive is how mature of a team player he's been so far, as he rarely tries to do things outside of his comfort zone, and has been a very willing ball mover looking to make the extra pass.", "Video Analysis: Strengths Ferguson has had some occasional flashes demonstrating his explosiveness attacking defenders in a straight line, but is a very rudimentary ball handler at this stage, even in the open floor due to his high and loose dribble.", "He looks a long ways off from being able to operate out of ball screens like most high end NBA shooting guards can, looking uncomfortable handling pressure in the half court.", "He doesn't have the skill set or feel for the game to consistently use his athleticism the way you might hope, as indicated by his paltry free throw attempt rate , but most of his turnovers have come off trying to make unselfish plays for teammates, as opposed to forcing the issue looking for points.", "Ferguson's jump shot is the basis of his game, and that has translated fairly nicely so far, as evidenced by his 39 3 point percentage.", "He elevates high off the ground, has a quick release point, is always on balance, and shoots it virtually the same every time, even with a hand in his face.", "He'll likely be able to make shots at a NBA level very early on in his career, especially from the corners, where he's extremely effective.", "Defensively, Ferguson has been somewhat of a mixed bag, which is not particularly surprising considering he's an 18 year old going up against grown men.", "His narrow frame has been a hindrance in terms of being able to get over screens, wall off penetration, and avoid getting pushed around inside the paint, but to his credit, he's played with a high level of competitiveness, which has helped mitigate those issues to a certain extent.", "Video Analysis: Weaknesses He uses his length and quickness effectively to contest shots on the perimeter, will throw his body around in the paint at times, and is light on his feet with strong lateral quickness.", "He's gaining invaluable experience going up against professionals with a 24 second shot clock, and has had some nice sparks showing the type of defender he can become as his frame continues to mature.", "All in all, Ferguson has done a nice job of acclimating himself to the NBL, and it will be very interesting to track the final two months of his season.", "He's obviously built a nice rapport so far with his teammates and coaching staff, which has clearly made his transition far smoother.", "Ferguson's ready made role as a 3'n'D wing has helped ease his adjustment to Australia and makes it easy to envision how a team can integrate him at the NBA level as well.", "He hasn't shown much at this stage to indicate he can be much more than that, which may put somewhat of a ceiling on his overall upside, and how high he could be drafted, but there is a huge need for players in his mold in today's basketball, which bodes well in his favor heading into June.You can follow Ferguson's season on the NBL's official website, or on NBL TV, where his games are streamed in high quality for just $5 per month.", "Fresh off of the announcement that he will not attend Arizona next season, but rather go pro and play in Australia for the Adelaide 36ers, Ferguson had a good, not great, showing at Stephen Curry Camp.", "From a physical standpoint, Ferguson looked a bit more developed, which is important given the fact that his likely NBA role is as a 3 and D style wing.", "In terms of on court skills, Ferguson hasn't added all that much to his game as perimeter defense, catch and shoot threes and opportunistic scores in transition are still his bread and butter.", "Ferguson, who is a 39.4 3 point shooter based on 259 attempts in our DraftExpress database, proved that he can be a bit streaky as a shooter.", "He can certainly get hot in a hurry as he catches on the hop, elevates and gets it off quickly without a lot of moving parts to his mechanics.", "But with that said, Ferguson has a bad habit of alligator arming his release and not getting maximum rotation on the ball.", "Even with some inconsistency, Ferguson still has the stroke to be a high level shooter with more and more repetitions.", "The 6' 7\u0094 Dallas native does has a long way to go as a shot creator as he's limited to mostly straight line drives.", "A tremendous athlete in transition, Ferguson isn't able to use that explosiveness in the half court, because the ball slows him down at times, evident by his 46.1 career 2 point percentage.", "He did show some signs operating from the mid post and pulling up in mid range spots after one or two dribbles, but becoming more sound with the ball will be the key to Ferguson's overall scoring upside.", "Defensively, Ferguson still has the tools and quickness to be elite, and given the shortage of size, length, athleticism and shot making ability on the wing in today's NBA, there's certainly a need

Mitchell finished the year as Louisville's fifth leading scorer, averaging an above average .931 points per possession.Offensively, Mitchell is a bit of a mixed bag.", "He was most effective as a finisher last season, shooting 59 around the rim overall according to Synergy Sports Technology as his explosiveness made him a threat to go up and finish lobs or explode over defenders to finish in traffic off the bounce.", "Attacking the rim with reckless abandon and being unafraid of contact, Mitchell has a powerful first step and proves capable of turning the corner with or without a ball

White can show consistency from NBA range, think the game at a higher level and prove he can impact the game as a perimeter defender during the pre draft process, he might have a chance to sneak into the second round of the 2017 NBA Draft.", "Jeremy BaumanA highly sought after RSCI Top 100 recruit coming out of high school, Andrew White spurned other major opportunities and committed to play for

which he scored 16.6 points per game and finally displayed his ability to be a true perimeter threat.White's journey won't end at Nebraska, however, as he graduated this past spring and decided to transfer to Syracuse of his attempts from behind the arc in his lone season at Nebraska.White has a knack for moving without the ball, regularly flowing off of flair screens, down screens and hand offs with the awareness and readiness to swiftly elevate and shoot.", "A product of his perimeter effectiveness, White floats along the edge of the 3 point line waiting for kick outs and ball reversals to take quick and unexpected shots.", "He has also flashed the ability to attack close outs with one and two dribble pull ups effectively.The Richmond, Virginia native thrived in transition because he's a dual threat; he runs the court well, gets out wide and uses long strides and good angles before finishing around the rim and is equally proficient spotting up from the perimeter, a useful skill in today's NBA.From a playmaking standpoint, the swingman leaves a lot to be desired, especially considering his advanced age and experience.", "White struggles to create shots for himself off the bounce in half court sets, and has rarely been relied upon to create offense in pick and roll situations.", "He also posted an incredibly low 20 total assists in 563 total minutes of playing time last year, demonstrating a lack of vision, passing ability, IQ or willingness to get his teammates involved more often.Entering his fifth season at the college level, White has been disappointing at the defensive end, especially for a wing player with above average physical attributes.", "His competitive nature is questionable, as he routinely gets caught sleeping when he's in weak side help situations, and he gets beat on drives to the rim way more frequently than he should because he doesn't take smart angles when closing out.", "White also shows little resistance when screened and gambles to help the post when guarding shooters far too often for a player at his stage of development.", "On a positive note, White does anticipate passing lanes well, has quick, strong hands and showed a willingness to box out and go after defensive rebounds on a regular basis.", "He led the Cornhuskers in rebounding with 5.9 per game and is an above average rebounder for his position.", "Transferring to Syracuse to play for Jim Boeheim's 2 3 zone defense certainly isn't going to alleviate concerns about White's abilities as a man to man defender at the next level, besides the fact that it will be easier to hide them.", "Still, he must prove that he's willing to compete on a more regular basis to be taken more seriously by decision makers, as just being a spot up shooter is not going to be enough to earn him rotation minutes or even a roster spot without something more to complement that.", "White, who will have just turned 24 years old when the 2017 NBA Draft

level in many facets of the game, as he can make mid range jumpers smoothly, attack defenders off the bounce, finish emphatically around the rim, an shows flashes defensively thanks to his agility.", "At the same time, Metu is a wildly inconsistent player who doesnt have a great feel for the game yet and is still polishing up his skill set and figuring out who he is as a player.", "He's not as

alongside highly touted frontcourt recruits such as Ivan Rabb, Stephen Zimmerman, and Stanley Johnson on the AAU circuit with the Oakland Soldiers, Chimezie Metu that indicate it's too early to entirely disregard form that shows some untapped potential, especially if he can consistently take higher quality looks than he did last season.", "Hitting that jumper consistently would open up a dribble drive game that could be an occasional weapon due to his quick first step and explosiveness around the basket.", "The defensive side is where Metu's impact is the most consistent right now, as he blocked 3.2 shots per 40 minutes, pace adjusted.", "Metu does a good job of maintaining verticality to prevent himself from picking up unnecessary fouls around the basket, although he still has difficulty staying out of foul trouble due to touch fouls on the perimeter.", "Metu seems like he has the type of build that his standing reach should be more in line with his height than his wingspan is, as his slender shoulders do him no service with the latter.", "That will help his chances if indeed the case, and he has excellent timing, a superb second jump, and shows good pursuit as a weakside shot blocker off the ball.", "Metu's defensive contributions aren't just limited to altering shots around the rim, however, as he moves his feet exceptionally well for a player his size, something that not only allows him to defend either frontcourt position, but also helps defend the pick and roll, allowing him to hedge and recover on pick and rolls or just flat out switch defensive assignments, traits that are extremely valued at the next level.", "His instincts on the perimeter still need some work, and he can get caught being overly aggressive in his rotations and be prone to mistakes, but the defensive base is intriguing, to say the least.", "Unfortunately, Metu was very disappointing on the defensive glass last season, pulling down just 11.1 of the available defensive rebounds while he was on the court for the Trojans.", "While Metu's shot blocking, pick and roll responsibilities, and instincts as a help defender certainly impact this extremely low number, he also doesn't consistently seek out a body to box out when the ball goes up and lacks the lower body strength, physicality and toughness to hold his ground when he is in position, something that also impacts his ability to defend the post.", "Considering Metu's expected low usage offensive role, having a glaring weakness on the defensive glass could hurt his chances to stick in a rotation, and he must get more productive in this aspect of the game.", "Overall, Metu has an athletic profile filled with defensive versatility that could make him an interesting prospect down the line, but he still

laden Wisconsin team headlined by Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker that made it all the way to the National Championship in 2015, Hayes returned to Madison as the obvious candidate to inherit the lion share of the scoring load left behind in the wake of the departure of five of the Badgers' seven leading scorers.", "Teaming with fellow holdover Bronson Koenig, Hayes seemed like a prime candidate for a breakout year in the Big Ten.Despite a preseason top 20 ranking, Wisconsin struggled to start the year, suffering early losses to Western Illinois and Milwaukee before Bo Ryan unexpectedly resigned after a December 15th win.", "With Ryan's chosen successor, Greg Gard, taking the reins and reemphasizing the swing offense, the Badgers had their highs and lows in conference play before an improbable Sweet 16 run.", "Much like Wisconsin as a whole, Hayes was inconsistent throughout the year, posting poor shooting numbers in his new role as the team's first option after ranking among the most efficient roleplayers in the country as a sophomore.", "Despite the major adjustment, the 21 year old forward averaged 15.7 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 3 assists over 36.2 minutes per game

only a single rebound in 39 minutes of action in two games.", "Left with no choice but to withdraw his name from consideration and return to school, the Toledo native will look to bolster his resume for a Wisconsin team that returns every major contributor from last season.Standing 6'7.25 in shoes with a gigantic 7'3 wingspan and a 245 pound frame, Hayes's intrigue at the NBA level has long started with his length and physical maturity.", "He possesses decent quickness and average explosiveness, however, looking more like a true power forward than the small forward he seemed to have some potential to become early on, which probably isn't too much of an issue in today's NBA anyway.Averaging 1.07 points over 11.6 possessions per game while shooting 48 on four one on one possessions per game as a sophomore, Hayes's impressive efficiency combined with his versatility and physical profile placed him one of the more interesting prospects in the Big Ten heading into last season.", "Without the benefit of the spacing Kaminsky and Dekker provided, though, things went downhill quick.", "Averaging 0.86 points over 18.3 possessions per game while shooting 37 on 9.6 one on one possessions per game as a junior, Hayes' shot making and ability to create off the dribble faltered badly as opposing defenses honed in on stopping him.", "Playing a demanding role alongside a young group, Hayes' strengths and weaknesses were magnified last season.A strikingly effective jump shooter as a sophomore, Hayes knocked down just under 40 of his 3 point attempts and 44 of his jumpers overall two years ago.", "Knocking down 29 of his attempts from deep this year and 31 of his perimeter shots overall, Hayes struggled to make uncontested and contested shots alike as his tendency to lock up his body in the air hurt his results as a junior and led to a lot of ugly misses.", "The expansion of his role played against him as well as he knocked down just 25 of a greater sample of pull up jump shots.Hayes' struggles converting shots in the midrange was a symptom of the difficulties he had creating shots overall.", "Lacking a degree of shiftiness with the ball in his hands, Hayes excelled at scoring inside two years ago playing off the ball against weaker defenders and in lineups with far superior perimeter shooting, but saw his effectiveness off the bounce plummet against systems centered around slowing him down as a sophomore.", "Converting 45 of his shots around the rim in the half court according to Synergy Sports Technology, Hayes forced the issue at times as a slasher and his lack of blow by quickness and great leaping ability led to a lot of difficult shots inside, and a number of near misses as defenders were able to recover after he beat them with his initial move.", "If there was one area where Hayes held mostly steady from his sophomore to his junior year, it was as a post option.", "Doing a nice job using his strength and drawing fouls with his back to the basket, his combination of aggressiveness, footwork, and craftiness helped him score effectively on the block.", "He doesn't use the most advanced moves, but has variety to his post repertoire using hooks with both hands and mixing in some spins and face up jumpers for good measure.", "As much as Hayes had a hard time finding an offensive rhythm this season, he often looked most comfortable on the block.While Hayes struggled last season after being thrust into a role as the Badgers' go to guy, it wouldn't be at all shocking to see him bounce back to some extent as a senior.", "Clearly, he's best suited for a smaller role, and scouts understand that.", "He'd certainly benefit from a strong year shooting the ball more consistently, which will be a huge key for him at the NBA level.Defensively, Hayes is a mixed bag.", "He's solid out on the perimeter for the most part, positioning himself well, but his lack of standout quickness limits him when asked to defend smaller players.", "His strength and length allow him to hold his own inside, but he doesn't rebound the ball at a particularly high rate as his lack of explosiveness and average toughness and intensity level limits his productivity on the boards.", "Despite all he's been through in the last year, Nigel Hayes remains one of the better NBA prospects in the senior class.", "His sophomore season remains a notable bright spot on his resume, even if his efficiency wasn't even close to sustainable in a bigger role.", "If he can re establish himself as a shooter and make better decisions creating with the

perspective.", "More so than almost any player in the country, Hayes did look to impose his will on the game offensively.", "Using a higher percentage of Wisconsin's possessions when he was on the floor than any player on Bo Ryan's roster, Hayes played a unique role for the Badgers offensively considering he played less than 20 minutes per game.", "More than 50 of his possessions came in one on one situations in the perimeter or the post, a distinction usually reserved for a prolific post scorer or a dominant inside outside weapon, not a freshman four man who lacks 3 point range.", "Some of Hayes's massive usage in one on one situations is systematic, but it is also rooted in how well his skill level compliments his physical tools.", "By no means is Hayes a glamorous offensive player, but his ability to put the ball on the floor with both hands, combined with a strong first step, strong lower body, and solid footwork under the rim make him difficult for most collegiate forwards to handle when operating with his back to the basket or facing up in the midrange.", "A bit turnover prone due to just how often he looks to bully his way inside, Hayes proves fairly effective finishing around the rim.", "He doesn't have outstanding touch, but his ability to create angles and absorb contact helped him shoot a solid 55 in post up and finishing situations, the large majority of which he created on his own.", "Shooting 67 off cuts according to Synergy Sports Technology, Hayes's finishing numbers bely his actual consistency due to the degree of difficulty of the shots attempts at the rim relative to the average player.", "Away from the rim, Hayes is a capable, but inefficient jump shooter.", "Sinking 24 of his 60 jump shots a year ago, his 40 shooting away from the rim reflects his ability to knock down jump shots when facing up or spotting up in the midrange, but his below average 0.8 points per jump shot shows how his lack of three point range limits the impact of this part of his game.", "Shooting just 59 from the free throw line, Hayes has plenty of room to grow as a shooter, but his quick, albeit somewhat rigid, shooting stroke appears to have the potential to be a tool for him long term.", "Aside from his scoring ability, Hayes's rebounding ability doesn't really jump off the page, especially defensively.", "His 2.2 offensive rebounds per 40 minutes pace adjusted and his 4.3 defensive rebounds per 40 minutes pace adjusted would both rank among the lowest marks among power forwards in top 100 if Hayes's name was in that mix.", "Though some of that is due to the contributions Wisconsin gets from its guards on the glass, scouts will be keeping an eye on Hayes's impact on the glass as he begins to assume a larger role in the coming seasons.", "Despite his short comings tracking down rebounds, Hayes was a surprisingly productive defender ranking among the 20 players in the country and one of only two freshmen who averaged over 1.2 blocks and 1.9 steals per 40 minutes pace adjusted last season.", "His combination of length and lateral quickness are fairly impressive, and although he was prone to some freshman mistakes, his knack for using his hands and being physical inside leave plenty of room for optimism about his future on this end of the floor, even if they did play into the 6 fouls he committed per 40 minutes pace adjusted.", "With Sam Dekker and Frank Kaminsky returning to Wisconsin, this season will be an interesting one for Hayes.", "He isn't likely to see his offensive role grow as much as many of his peers in the sophomore class, but he is likely to once again be a significant factor for one of the nation's elite teams when he's on the floor.", "Hayes's lack of size and poor rebounding numbers are

from Turkey this past week.", "Playing with a huge motor, Mathias shows impressive physical tools, playing above the rim with the ease and having great speed in the open court and pick and roll.", "Lessort is a bit undersized for a center and doesnt show the type of scoring range or playmaking ability from someone who might play some power forward, even if his intensity level and length on defense does help ease some of those concerns.", "The way the NBA game is trending will certainly benefit him, as teams are far less reluctant to use 69 centers as in the past, especially one with Lessorts bulk.", "Once the NCAA Tournament comes to a close, NBA teams will likely head to France in great numbers to watch how he finishes his season and compare him with the many big men prospects hell stack up against in the Draft.", "Lessorts season will likely go well into May and possibly June, which will prevent him from doing as many workouts as some teams might hope.", "Considering the role he plays in a strong league like France, in a very comfortable scouting location such as Paris, as well as his success in European competition, NBA scouts will have plenty to work off of.",

executing simple moves and being spoon fed by his guards, as his feel for the game is still work in progress.", "He doesn't have much of a back to the basket game, as his footwork is rudimentary and

also not a great passer, averaging two and a half times as many turnovers as assists on the year.", "Where Lessort is likely to bring a team the most value in the short term is via his energy defensively and on the glass.", "He brings a high activity level, as well as excellent toughness, and can be quite a playmaker when combined with his strong physical tools, as evidenced by his 1.6

around.", "Lessort's quick feet and intensity level give him quite a bit of versatility guarding the pick and roll, where he can hedge and recover, switch onto smaller players, and still offer rim protection with his length.", "He's not afraid to mix it up inside, will step in for charges, is quick to get in the passing lanes, and shows the mobility to stay with power forwards.", "Video Analysis: WeaknessesLessort has made significant strides defensively this season, something that was certainly not considered a major strength of his last year, partially due to the fact that he was on a Chalon team that put zero emphasis on that end of the floor.", "Still, there is work to be done to become a more disciplined, aware and fundamentally sound player.", "Lessort can be overly aggressive at times, biting on fakes, giving up deep post position, losing his focus off the ball, and committing silly fouls.", "He's not immune to getting scored on by bigger players, and is just an average defensive rebounder, as he doesn't always find a body to box out, and does not have elite reach for a center.", "Rim running, high energy big men in Lessort's mold who rebound, finish above the rim and cover ground defensively are becoming increasingly popular in today's NBA, as players like Ed Davis and Tarik Black are demonstrating.", "His upside is limited to a certain extent by his lack of height, age, average skill level and feel for the game, but considering his seemingly strong intangibles, excellent production in Europe this season, and solid track record of French prospects, it's easy to see an NBA team drafting him in the second round, possibly very early on.", "The fact that he has the flexibility to come over right away and play a role on a cheap contract,

Hart mixing it up with much bigger players in the paint, dead sprinting up the wing on the break, or hitting the floor pursuing a loose ball or after absorbing contact.Hart's motor paid obvious dividends for him as a freshman in Villanova's undersized lineup.", "Nearly a third of his offensive possessions came in transition or on put backs according to Synergy Sports Technology.", "On the whole he made a tremendous 65.9 of his shots in transition, and 67.4 around the rim in the half court thanks to his timing, elite offensive rebounding ability for a guard, and outstanding body control when looking to convert in close.", "The Sidwell Friends product ranked among the NCAA leaders in two point percentage as a freshman, a space normally reserved for big men living off a diet of catch and finish opportunities.Part of Hart's high 2 point percentage can be attributed to how few midrange jump shots he attempted.", "Normally the third or fourth option when he was on the floor, if Hart was taking a jump shot, it was usually a three pointer of the catch and shoot variety.", "Knocking down 33 of such attempts, Hart showed the ability to space the floor efficiently for stretches, but

improving his jump shot and creating shots off the dribble beyond attacking closeouts.Defensively, Hart competes with the same urgency he brings offensively.", "Often asked to defend multiple positions over the course of a game, Hart has good, but not great lateral quickness, leaving his mark as an individual defender thanks to his consistent energy.", "He could stand to get stronger and be a bit more physical defending dribble penetration and fighting through screens, but he has a nice base to build on overall on this end of the floor.Hart was among the more efficient freshman role

decisive, low to the ground and catches the defense off guard with his release.He has improved as a catch and shoot option during his three seasons at the college level but still has to work on his

limitations in terms of size, wingspan and strength as it feels like he's nearly maximized his potential on this end of the court.Mason, who will turn 23 in April, is as an older guard who has
